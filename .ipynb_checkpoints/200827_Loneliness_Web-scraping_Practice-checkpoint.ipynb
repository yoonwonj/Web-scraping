I had no keys, when she opened the door for me. I stood there for sometime, when I witness her. She looked even more beautiful that day.

But I was too shy to take one.', 'Few days, we kept greeting and thanking each other at small-small things like picking up each others package. But I was too nervous to initiate a conversation with her. But she felt different. So one day, I took initiative.', 'We always happened to see each other during cooking or filling water in the kitchen. So when I came downstairs, I saw her cooking. When she saw me coming towards her, she smiled back. I responded the same way. But by then, I wasn’t feeling the same way as before. I became conscious as I was juggling with so many thoughts. I had prepared my conversation beforehand already, but I couldn’t even say a word and I left in a hurry. I was really upset that day with myself.', 'After few days of eating outside, I thought of cooking inside home. Meanwhile, I felt like serving her too and start a healthy conversation. She felt happy and thanked me when I kept food for her. And we started talking. While coming back from office, I used to eagerly wait for her and we used to talk a lot. I was loving her company after all. But I never knew that I was falling for her too.', 'One afternoon, I was busy in cooking when I saw her coming but she was disturbed and felt sick. She was having cold and fever. I was concerned about her, but she filled water and left without saying a word. She was affecting me every now and then and so, I thought of making her a coffee. I always used to prefer her calling and texting before knocking her door as I thought she might feel uncomfortable. But I was overthinking anyways. I did the same but I couldn’t receive any reply after repeatedly knocking her door too. I couldn’t focus further on my cooking. I threw the coffee away in disappointment.', 'After sometime, I heard someone coming downstairs and I saw her.', 'She:', 'Hey. I am really sorry. I slept off.

Please wait for sometime.', 'She smiled back and thanked me. I saw her smiling beautifully after so many days and I started preparing coffee again.

But fortunately, somehow, I always happened to see her. Her smile and beautiful eyes were magical.', 'One day, I was leaving for office and I thought of keeping the food for her too.

I felt numb and silent that instant. I was shattered into pieces after all. Maybe, I was expecting a lot from her. I couldn’t control my emotions and I stopped myself to responding her further. I never knew what was affecting me so much. She was just a flatmate and she had a right to do whatever she prefers. But I couldn’t understand this hypothesis. This time, I never felt like going home and I wanted to stay the whole day at office. But I had no choice. Maybe I was too nervous to talk to her now. I was overthinking. I felt if something had changed amongst us. Maybe, she might have felt differently now about me. I was really anxious and started making conclusions unnecessarily.', 'After few days, I couldn’t talk to her or greet her. I stopped cooking too now. I was feeling suffocated in silence as we were not talking as before. And so, I stopped taking initiatives and I even stopped texting her. But somehow, it was affecting my work too at office.

I stopped caring for things, I used to do before.', 'One day, I couldn’t control my emotions and started crying while talking to my mom. I never had bad intentions after all. She was a good friend of mine and so I couldn’t stop myself than narrating everything, whatever I felt for so long. Because it was affecting my other relations too. My mom listened to me.', 'Mom:', 'You are a good person and always caring. But during these times, we always forget that someone, whom you are caring for, is comfortable or ready too. Undoubtedly, she is a nice girl and respecting a girl is always your priority. The problem is not that you cared for someone so much or you had some bad intentions. Never underestimate yourself in situations like this. Always be thankful to God that you have been given a gift to cherish or make someones lives beautiful after all. You think and care about someone so much. No one will be against you. Never. Mark my word. But expecting too much from someone, you hardly knew makes it a lot tougher. Sometimes, even I am not comfortable of taking gestures from someone, so does that make me bad? Never. If you respect yourself for whatever change you bring in someones life, respect the same way when someone express her feelings. And I am glad you took your time to think about this and show your vulnerabilities. This is part of your life. But overcoming these challenges makes you a better person every now and then. Don’t stop learning. You keep serving people as always. Thats your identity and beautiful characteristic. But at the same time, keep your expectations aside. At last, I want to say I am so proud of you. You did your job very well.', 'I never knew I would have a conversation ever with my mom about a girl. Maybe I never took an initiative. I couldn’t sleep properly for few days as I was seeking so many answers. But after I talked to my mom, I felt relived and slept off.', 'The next day, somehow, I felt confident when I woke up. It was a beautiful day after all. I was focussed now and I was back on track. I was smiling and laughing at small-small things for now. After all, I was glad and grateful to God for having this beautiful life.', 'After all, no one has any bad intentions. She never stopped talking to me. Later, she took an initiative and responded me very well. And we were back on track. But, after understanding these situations, I kept my expectations aside and started doing selflessly. And so, I have felt so happy after that. In moments like this, we get out of control and hurt our loved ones unexpectedly. But its better to take sometime off and think about what needs to be done. Because losing your loved ones is not always an option. You can’t control situations like this, but you can stick to your plan and do things for them selflessly because whenever you go to bed, you will always sleep well that you made someones smile beautifully and you will smile back then', '.', \"I tried to prevent myself from caring and writing an answer for this question as I am not a regular user of Quora but I guess even after getting used to loneliness and isolation after years of experience, amazingly I still have some desires left deep within me which make me want to share my story with other people. Damn you human brain, you're so hard to figure out!\", 'Okay, so a severe case of loneliness here. And let me start by saying how glad it makes me feel to see the 100+ answers to this question and I think may be at least 10% of these people will be able to relate with the extent of my relationship with loneliness. I am not a special or an unusual example in any sense and could easily attest to most of the things mentioned in some of the other answers here which I just went through, except that may be I find a sharper version of some in my life and have a couple of things to add.', 'Introduction.', \"I am almost 28 year old, a straight male and from a demographic which would be considered the majority in many spheres. I do not suffer from any social anxiety, or a documented disorder which would prevent me from normal interactions in any situation (and trust me I have done my research). I don't exactly know what's wrong with me and only reason I could offer is that I am too different from most people and too indifferent to care about it, especially now and at this age.\", \"Just to give you a taste of what my life is like, I have been living alone for many years now. The only people I know and communicate with in any capacity are work friends, or rather colleagues. Outside this circle, I have conversed with my parents, siblings and may be 3 other “friends” in the whole of last year. I don't recall the last time my phone rang with a non marketing call. But all these things are pretty normal in any lonely person's life and there is nothing new about mine.\", 'What I will instead describe here are mostly the psychological effects and tribulations that it entails, and again, apologies in advance if these have been shared before. I have been in this state for more than 4 years now with few short laps of human contact here and there (more on that as I go on), which in retrospect might only have exacerbated the pain of an otherwise consistent lifestyle. And as any discussion on loneliness is incomplete without the mention of relationship, I would say I have none, and never had one with the exception of a couple short lived flings constituting those aforementioned companionship experiences.', 'Time.', 'The biggest and most crucial factor in the extremities of loneliness is the factor of time. And granted, I may not have yet experienced extraordinary lengths of time that some of the other responders here have, I still have gone through many phases and changed a whole lot during this period. The thing about humans is that we are pathologically social beings, to the point of almost non-existence in complete isolation (true for most of us). Our personalities, and our memories shape in the way they do because they contain the element of company in them. Having spent most of my 20s in moderate to extreme isolation, I can feel the difference between my childhood memories and those from last few years. The latter are only revived in brain with a distinct vacuousness, as if they are soulless and the only parts that shine among them are the ones which contain the presence of someone else. As a matter of fact, most of my alone memories and experiences I created can be washed out by one tinge of a powerful remembrance that includes another human being. The way it affects me is subtle. Years go by and I don\\'t \"fully\" realize I have really lived a life. So strictly speaking, it becomes less of an existence than that of a normal human being.', 'Emotions.', 'Emotions are hardest and most unpredictable part to achieve control over. I have gone through very miserable cycles of utter despair, heartbreak, depression and insomnia before arriving at a point where tears have become hard to bring about. And given my lonely existence, other psychological afflictions like emotional vulnerabilities, predilection to romanticism, lower confidence, premature attachment, many insecurities etc. are difficult to avoid and have been an integral part of my personality. But this question is not about that and I will spare all the details. The key takeaway is that lonely people are more susceptible to emotional breakdowns and experience higher degree of pains from break-ups and other strains in relationships or attachments in general. I am no exception to that.', 'Phases.', 'Here\\'s where it gets interesting. When I started this journey I was a novice, and utterly clueless of what lay ahead in future. I was thrown into a situation where inevitably I was forced to live a life that I have never wanted or anticipated. I started with zero experience in this and can now dare to call myself an expert on loneliness, but that doesn\\'t mean I still don\\'t learn a lot about it or about myself everyday. The next few lines are very specific to me and don\\'t generalize well to loners unlike most of my other description. The first phase was of getting used to the new circumstances, and it was easiest of all since it still consisted of my leftover remains from years before and a struggle and hope to keep them alive. The next phase was filled with heavy disappointment caused by failures from former stage and a long period of bereavement for an unrequited love, extreme episodes of depression and the onset of desperation for companionship. The third and very long phase was the peak of this desperation and a sort of final attempt to achieve the normalcy through multiple efforts for securing love or engaging in other social activities which resulted into partial but temporary success. The fourth phase (in so far) has been the acceptance of fate, avoidance of triggers, masking of feelings, and an overall emotional frigidity. And ironically, the closest I have come to feeling \"happy\" in all these years has been in the current phase.', 'Changes.', 'Chronic loneliness changes you, at primitive biological level. And I say this not just because I sense it or have experienced it but also because research in neuroscience has shown the occurrences of physical changes in our brains long after we step into adulthood, and possibly lifelong. I still adapt myself everyday to new waves of loneliness and sometimes hard earned lessons need repeated reminding to be fully learnt and put in practice. I have heard that being lonely and single only gets harder as one gets older. So far I have only heard this, but there is little I can do other than mentally preparing myself for the future.', 'Summary.', \"Life means very different thing to me than to most people. It's less of a pursuit and more of a curiosity and challenge for me. What started out as a mild and later excruciating pain that I wanted to get immediately rid of, has turned into something deep, something meaningful. Loneliness is my most reliable companion now, as it never leaves me alone. I am not depressed anymore, lost may be, but not wallowing in constant agony. And it's only the beginning but I like to think that the worst part of this experience, getting accustomed to it, is over. I am very likely wrong in believing that this was the worst part but making my peace with living this way was crossing of a big hurdle for me. I know that having been made by the genes which are wired for attachment and intimate alliance with someone from the same species, though I can never claim victory over loneliness, it can be soothed and adapted towards an ultimate acceptance. Besides, I am still living in a functioning breathing society of humans, not in a forest, and hopefully the silent passive company of others will be enough consolation for me to survive!\", 'Thank you for your attention.', \"I am 29 years old female, working and living alone. Growing up i had pretty casual and peaceful childhood. While I love my family and don't hold any grudges against them, it's only now that I'm starting to realize how different I am to them.\", \"I am a person who just loves to chat, laugh, discuss different topics, show affection, spend time with people (especially the family and the ones important to me), support each other in difficult situations and celebrate the good ones. I adore waking up in the morning, knowing I'll be sharing it with someone positive and start the day smiling, sharing the breakfast. My heart is excited when I think of spending the evenings surrounded by people I love.\", \"On the opposite, in our house every one of us was mostly spending time in their own room/place, ignoring each other. Mother was busy with her own things (i was always begging her to include me in her housekeeping tasks, just so that I could spend some time with her, but was rejected every time), father as well, brother didn't even speak to me mostly. Ever since I was a child, I was jealous of my friend's families, secretly wishing that someone would show that affection and attention to me as well. Even now, when i visit my family every couple of months (i live in another country), they don’t speak to me much. When i left the home to live abroad for a year, my brother didn’t even come out of his room to say goodbye.\", 'However, time passed by, my extroverted personality brought me many friends on my way and I found that piece of attention I needed. I also had two serious relationships during this time, which eventually ended and I have now been single for the last few years.', \"I built my career, moved abroad and in general was developing myself in this time. But that eagerness for a closeness remained. That feeling of loneliness, even when being surrounded by people. I don't know why things turned out that way as they are. I am talkative, people are all the time giving me compliments about my physical looks (please, don't understand this as bragging, I'm only trying to describe the situation), but for some reason life hasn't given me the chance to meet a man, with whom I could start a loving, happy family. I have a lot of friends, meet a lot of new people, but I guess there is just something about my personality that doesn't allow to get on a deeper level. Because you know, even if you do always have a person to call if you want to have a coffee, this isn't enough. These are platonic relationships, which are of course nice, but they don't take away the loneliness. It actually breaks a heart a bit, when you meet your friend for a chat and after she rushes back home to her loving husband and two beautiful sons, and you… you go back to your empty, quiet apartment.\", \"I am aware of the fact that my perception of loneliness is greatly influenced by the ignorance and lack of affection in my growing years, that is why I completely understand that for some people the situation I'm in wouldn't represent loneliness. But after some time, I guess it takes more than just meeting people for a couple of hours, but instead finding someone to be around even on a Sunday night.\", \"Thank you very much for reading. I'm sorry for a bit confused text, my writing talents are on zero, especially when writing about my inner thoughts.\", 'With love,', 'U', 'I am so terrifyingly lonely.', 'I am a married 25 year old woman. As a child, I was invisible. No one cared about what I had to say, what I was thinking or even what I was doing. My proudest moments went unrecognised and unappreciated, which slowly turned me into someone who was never good enough. Who will never be good enough, no matter what I do. My life was dedicated to pleasing others, constantly trying to attain recognition, to be seen, heard.. collecting the rare scraps of approval thrown my way. This was my coping strategy and I lived like that for a long time.', 'Then, I gave birth to my child. Consequently, I was hit very hard with postnatal depression. Once you fall into depression, it is so so hard to climb out.. and then of course you are even more lonely because no one wants to be around a broody person all day… and so the cycle continues..', 'In other words, the crap finally hit the fan.', 'I became withdrawn and agitated with unbearable mood swings. I closed up into myself and refused to let anyone in, least of all those closest to me.', 'Anyone who hasn’t been through depression cannot begin to understand what you are going through - and that’s about everyone I know. My husband. My family. My colleagues. Needless to say, I have no friends. No one understands me, I have no one to talk to.', 'I am so terrifyingly lonely.', 'But I do believe that ‘what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger’. I need to look out for myself and take care of myself. If I do that, and persevere through this, I will come out so much stronger.

I could count the number of my truly best friends on only a hand. These few best friends, I related with differently according to each's distinctive traits and quirks as I saw them. That means there were some whom I'd oftenly share jokes with; others, discuss personal matters; others still, discuss about movies, intellectual stuffs, and others.

I don't understand relationship-forming and how it works, and have on few occasions tried to no success. It befuddles me to see two people in a relationship; it fills me with wonder how it worked, how it started, and how they agreed to be so. In high school and in the university, I had to observe as people form, break up and re-form relationships, and I never really actively ventured to participate in all these social drama. A part of me wanted it, the other forbid me. I occasionally felt emotionally weak and sad within and all, but still, I was paradoxically resolute to avoid any relationship. I was filled with a powerful sense of self-independence and -ownership.\", \"There have been numerous “self-relizations” that hit me that “I am destined to be alone”—“That I wasn't made for relationships.” These realizations especially hit me almost always after having some of my habitual, musing cogitations about myself and life in general.

The nights as well have the morbid pleasure of throwing at you to your horror, darkness and freaky, nightly sounds.

It isn't something I thought about often until my daughter commented that I don't have any friends… and I had to admit that she was right, at least to a degree. I do have a long term best friend, one who acknowledges that I am his best friend as well, so there is no fear that one day he's going to call me an acquaintance.

Let me start by introducing myself. I am a 25 year old guy from India who recently started college in Mumbai and having a hard time getting adjusted to the city’s flow and culture. I have been a victim of depression, social anxiety and inferiority complex since the last few years. I am shy, introverted and have problems approaching and talking to people of my age (I am pretty confident when interacted with people with a specific purpose like work, talking to a teacher, etc). I have only one friend in the whole world, the best friend a guy could want, who is a thousand kilometers away from me right now. I miss my home, my parents, my room, my bed, my chair, and the list goes on.', 'Normally, I’m not a guy to get homesick or very emotional when it comes to people and places but this time I really struck a beat. Till now I used to fake being an extrovert and the life of the party to avoid being perceived as the lonely loser. I am a little shy, protective of myself and don’t let people in very easily. A few individuals made the effort to break the barrier even after multiple attempts. I really appreciated their effort, made me feel wanted, made me feel like I meant something to them. I call those individuals', '“friends”', 'now. After the barrier gets broken, I don’t have any problem with connecting. It’s just that I tend to lose those', '“friends”', 'quickly too. They always end up being better friends with other people. Honestly, I don’t who is at fault here. I don’t know if I did anything to push them away. I never get to know what they think. This time I didn’t have any interest in making friends. Start college, study, finish college, get out; that was the plan. I didn’t wish to make friends. I just wanted to be on good terms with people. My plan had one tiny flaw. I have a problem with girls. I say girls because my issues only involves girls of my age and not other women.', 'It is extremely difficult for me to approach people to be friends with them. If I do approach people, it’s because I am inquiring about something or have something official to say. In class, I normally avoid interacting with anyone on the first day. First day is observation day, observing the other kids and then deciding who is fit to be my friend. It is pretty clear by a student’s attitude if he is an ambitious person or just a dumb idiot who likes to', 'partay', 'all the time. I prefer the former because I got some serious goals to reach.', 'I don’t care much if guys ignore me or push me away or don’t want to be my friends. I’ve got a fair share of guy friends back home. I do care about the female presence in my life. The only females I have ever had in my life are my mom and my sister. I have never had a female friend or a girlfriend. I don’t have any girls in my phone book too, apart from older colleagues of course. The ones that I did have never called or messaged me, so I trashed those contacts. At this point in life, I am craving some female presence around me. Since the beginning of my time, girls used to laugh at me and consider me a nobody. I was invisible even if other guys weren’t around.', 'This area of my life is the reason for most of my anger. I see other guys hanging out with girls, I see those girls taking an interest in the guys, I see them interacting very well with those guys and it just makes me feel very bad. When I came here in Mumbai to start my college, my anxiety took a hike and I had a panic attack right in the middle of the college’s admission hall. Every where I looked I saw the same kind of girls who laughed at me. Here in Mumbai, all girls look like they are models or are very rich and very celebrity like. I was taught since birth that this particular kind of lifestyle suits the high society only and my family is far below that, so I am having even more trouble adjusting to the fact that every one here is so much upscale than me, specifically girls (who, after much observation, I know aren’t millionaires. Some are even poorer than me money wise). I have no idea if every girl in my college is a rich brat or they are just overly fancy here.', 'Before I moved to Mumbai, I had less problems connecting with people. I had problems nonetheless. I get overly self conscious about my appearance and physique, which is not breathtaking. I am 5’8”, 120 kg, beer belly, not so good looking. Some might call me ugly. With that said, I certainly don’t expect super hot girls to befriend me. Super hot girls are very rare even here in Mumbai even though each girls tries to be one. For me, 8 out of 10 girls here seem super hot. The remaining 2 aren’t as pretty but they are beautiful. Some are even cool. There was this girl I used to work with, she was totally cool when I swore loudly. I thought she was really fun but for some reason, the friendship melted away.', 'I have a lot of anger inside me. On my first day in college, I actually interacted with a girl for five seconds. She smiled at me, I was taken aback but I forced a smile. I expected her to talk with me more but that was it. I ran into the same girl again the next day and attempted to start a conversation but no (actually this one wasn’t even super hot). I don’t get angry when girls don’t want to talk to me or be my friend, I get angry when they would rather talk with some other guy than me. What do others have that I don’t? Just because I don’t look like a Greek god, girls decide I am a loser! I have never ever got a Tinder match while most guys, even the bad ones, get at least 2 – 3 matches here in Mumbai. Their bios say', '“like to meet new people and make friends”', 'but for some reason we never match.', 'On some days, I cannot help but loathe these girls. Sometimes, even while watching porn I half wish the guy would stop fucking the bitch and bang her head on the table. I have an extreme itch to just shout “FUCK YOU BITCH!!!” at the girls in my college and shoot them in the head. I realize that it won’t do anybody any good once I cool down a little. It’s just that in that little period of outburst I feel I can’t focus on anything. I am getting a ton of stress and frustration thinking about this issue, which seems to be in my mind all day long. I keep wishing and searching for something cool in my life that would make the girls think', '“Aww shit! Wish we had made friends with him!”', '. It’s not like I haven’t tried approaching girls, but for some reason I don’t get the response I expect. In fact, the response is pretty lame. Why can’t a girl approach me for a change?', 'I fear my academics can get affected by my issues, which is the last thing I want. On my third day I smiled at one girl in the hallway. All I got was a forced, crooked smile and a weird look. I have seen other guys do the same and get the girl to reciprocate. I keep wondering is it because the other guy is good-looking. If so then why do people label me as a pervert when I say I just want girls with a cute face, big boobs and a nice ass in my life? If that is wrong then girls, too, should come and talk to me without any problem and without judging me by looks.', 'My mind is completely exhausted after dealing with this wretched issue all my life. My head aches at the slightest stimulation. I want the will power to accept that I won’t have any female presence in my life, like ever. I want the strength to accept that I am below, below average looking and no girl would come up to me, ever. Every girl I see is hanging out with some other guy and it just makes me feel very bad. Everyday is a new war I am fighting with myself. Every night I cry myself to sleep, promising myself that I won’t think about these things and will focus on studies but it’s the same story everyday. Writing about it does make me feel a little lighter but I have to face the same thing every morning every damn day. I want to get through college as a loner but can’t get all of these thoughts out of my mind when I see the girls. This is why I feel very lonely in this new city and miss my small, not so upscale, quiet, mini-city very much.', 'All I wanted was just a friend, a female friend. It sounds crazy but yeah, I wanted to have a female friend first. All I wanted was to feel wanted by the girls around me, like other guys. I still daydream about a fictional girl who will come up to me and tell me she wants to be my friend before all the other guys. I guess that happens only in movies. I am not even thinking about romance or a girlfriend. That destination is miles away. My frustration is eating me day and night. So what if I am fat and ugly? So what if I am shy and introverted? Does that mean I am not good enough? I honestly don’t know what to do.', '“Just be yourself and have a conversation”', 'doesn’t work. This has gone to the point where I don’t even like looking at girls, in real life or in movies/TV shows/porn/etc. It is giving me a bad headache all day.', \"I don’t know how do I start my story. I m a 24-year-old guy from India. I was lonely and isolated my whole life even since when I was a kid. I had no fun and happiness in life at all. I have never felt it. There is no one who loves me and no one cares about me, not even my own parents. When I m a shy and introvert guy and no one understands me here. When I was in school I had few friends only boys no girls because girls used to ignore me. I was really immature and very dumb. I have never even kissed a girl in my life ever. Girls didn’t like me at all. I got bullied and harassed so many times in school. Same story when I got into an engineering college. I drop out of college after 1 year because I couldn’t able to complete it, I felt like it was not for me. My life is a complete failure. I have made so many wrong choices and now I have lost it completely. Whatever I have done in life I was always miserably failed in it. It was not all my fault, my parents are unsupportive and uneducated, we are a middle class. They never understand and loved me. They have never encouraged me for anything always scolds me for everything. on the other hand, there is society pressure too. I m so trapped and isolated in life that nobody could understand. I have relatives and cousins but they are just full of hate and negativity. I really do not like people here. I don’t even have good neighbors. I m just living in hell. My parents don’t even allow me to do anything in life. I m just stuck in my room for years. I can’t able to do anything life. Due to all of this, I m extremely depressed and isolated my whole life. I feel no connection with the world. I wish I could leave this place forever but It is impossible. I can’t even a good job so I could get out. I don’t even have money and rest my parents. Due to years of mental illness, I have developed so many psychological disorders like bipolar disorder, extreme introversion, social anxiety, extreme depression, autism spectrum disorder, and loneliness and so on and on. It's hard to handle my life. Every day is just hell, thinking about suicide all day long, every moment, I don’t even know when I was the last time I was truly happy in life. I m really afraid of death because I know that this is the only life I have and I don’t want to miss the chance. I have so many dreams like I want to marry a beautiful, loving girlfriend who will love me and I want to travel the world with her. I want to live in the USA and Europe because I like those countries. These are my dreams of life but now it is gone, it is impossible for me to achieve that. But I don’t know whenever I try to give up on life completely there is something which stops me because somehow in my heart I still crave for a better life. I want to live a better and peaceful life. I do believe in God but he is also not listening to my prayers. I have so many cousins who are so much lucky and successful than me because they have good and supporting parents and they live in much better western countries. They moved there when they were just kids with their parents. I don’t know why it happened to me. I never thought that I would be in this phase of life but here I m. I wish somehow I could restart my life again from a new beginning but I can’t. It's over.\", 'I am a female at 21 years of age and have nothing going for me. I would love some advice.', 'Despite being told I am pretty and get stared at by men, I have had zero dates in my life. In high school I never had a date to a dance, and I got to see all my smiling classmates posing with a guy during prom. They all got asked out in the cutest way. I cannot imagine a man even taking hours of his time to ask me out. I only ever liked one guy in my life, and upon telling him I liked him, he brushed me off and ended up taking out a blonde girl with big tits. Why am I surprised?', 'Men in my life see me as disposable. My dad and brother see me as a retard. Everything I say is brushed aside and I am called names. Slut, ugly, stupid, worthless - my dad said I was going to end up a prostitute one day, despite being the most prudish girl. I am a size zero and take care of my health and appearance, but I am highly concerned that by the time I am thirty, my market value would be even lower to men.

Other girls are so superficial to me - only concerned about boy troubles and taking the best selfies. Really petty stuff. They smack talk everyone. I only have two friends I see on the holidays occasionally. At their parties, I feel very left out because the other girls see me as an alien. I am sorry I don’t wear heavy makeup and don’t take ten selfies a day to show my thousand followers on Instagram.

I have health issues that make it hard for me to drive to his home and I can't afford to go any other way. I have a sister (1 out of 7 siblings) that I do hear from, but she lives several hours away in another direction.

I went to a missionary school till the 10th grade and the rules that one had to adhere to made me even more scared to interact with my peers and teachers.

I was still a quiet kid and most people still thought I was a weirdo. I had low self-esteem and felt terrible about my appearance.

Did I feel she always reciprocated? Not really. But I felt that’s what I was supposed to do. You see, I had realized something by now: I was incapable of forming good bonds with people.

I’m a precocious white boy born in a crossfire hurricane; don’t let the haircut or the nice manners fool you. There’s fire in my fingertips, sparks fly when my sneakers hit the sidewalk. I was crowned with a spike right through my head—or it could be I had a little too much coffee this morning.

I’ve measured out my life in garden tools—after all, we are what we touch, at least in part. Winter is over, I’m shackled to a harsh brain and I have a lot of work to do. The sun is shining, the loneliness searing, and I’m so grateful to be able to step through it all that my fingers tremble. The cherries are blooming, full throttle and ecstatic. It’s like they’re singing. A mockingbird does just that and it’s all right now, at least until a different emotion unfolds and I’m blinded by its color, form and scent. I bend a sprawling rose branch my way and snip. The growing season has begun.', 'I am in mid 30s, female, alone. (India)', 'When i was in school there were 3 girls groups out of i belonged to no particular group. College, i had people around me but i had no friends and ended up growing alone. Due to few issues from families only friend of mine for 10 months, she also left me. I was only daughter and my parents are not like sweetest ones who sit next to me, talk to me,console me and never gave me uplift when i was dealing with study issues. I spent most of the time in my room alone not knowing what i was going through but thankfully sometimes listening to FM when there was power at home. I was not matured to know what does even being alone means.', 'After i graduated and started working i got lot of friends in office more than just being colleagues. I use to be in group always. I was the common friend of many groups but i had no close friend of me who calls me, talk to me, spend time with me other than work. The moment i sit in cab, i use to put earphones and listen to music. Cry, laugh, feel good, bad, sad with myself. Meanwhile parents started forcing me to marry and due to this there use to be lot of arguments at home. Because of situations like this at home, i started feeling more n more lonely even being with parents n siblings cause one or the other reason one by one stopped talking to me. I spent many years in my room alone either reading something, writing how i was feeling, listening to music or sleeping forcefully, writing Sri Rama Jayam( I don’t know why i was writing for). Still did not understood what loneliness meant.', 'I look good and intelligent enough. I use to get lot of proposals since my college days, most of my friends use to tell me “ guy will be very lucky to get a girl like u” since my college days. Due to family and social reputation i left to parents to choose a guy for me. Nothing worked out, few which i liked did not work out, Guys who approached me for marriage did not work out., Still i do not know y this happened to me. All of friends(Male n Female) started settling down with their loved ones, started having kids and started inviting me for anniversary, birthdays,house warming . I had to literally avoid talking to them. I deactivated facebook, stopped using whatsapp n other social media. Not because of jealous or fear but to avoid questions such as “u r such a nice person but how u r not able to settle down, not getting guy, do some poojas, compromise lot so that u will get someone, don’t delay, u r getting old,don’t u have feelings” blah blah which was killing my confidence to live day by day.

For my bad fate, i found a friend in the guy who proposed and asked me to marry him but in few days he called off the wedding n left me. I survived this damage being alone. It was always like i had everything but i had nothing. I had everyone but i had no-one. I always use to go every where alone, i use to spend most of my time in temples on weekends, i never use to take leaves unless my manager reminds me i have not availed leaves for months. Worst part was when i was sick enough and cannot walk to hospital, even then i use to go alone thinking this is my life and i will have to do everything on my own. Four walls of my room have seen the most of the loneliness and impacts of it.', 'I reached to the stage that mind has accepted and tuned to being alone, not expecting anyone to fill it. Do everything on my own, feel nothing for the void, accept the hard reality that may be this is how my life is designed and move on with the state of being alone. When the life is not similar to people in society, it creates lot of gap in connecting people and life becomes harder. Now, as on today, i am alone with no friends, (no job for quite sometime so no new people around),no social life, no family life yet i am living. My house is full of people and i am alone. Finally i have understood what does loneliness mean.', 'Oh soooo so so so lonesome. I’ve spent the entirety of my 20 year old life without any serious romantic interactions. I have good friends, but I don’t know how to communicate with my family. This situation gives me an overwhelming sensation of unending isolation, even though my friends keep me plenty occupied. The most frustrating part is that I actually really like myself, and I don’t understand why I don’t leave big impressions on people. I’m not a narcissist either, I do my best to be as self aware as I can manage; I don’t necessarily resent anybody for not being head over heals for me, but I can’t help my emotions.', 'I’m an artist, I have good taste in music, I have my personal sense of style, I have good hair, and I actually think I’m pretty attractive. Despite my romantic ammunition, I’ve yet to make any ground. While I’m very interested in getting out and seeing the world once in a while, I have some introverted tendencies. By “some introverted tendencies”, I mean I spend most of my time in my room drawing, gaming, watching YouTube and anime, and practicing guitar here and there. Oh, and I watch way too much pornography… (whoops).', 'Now, I know what you’re thinking; “Why does this guy complain about being single if he doesn’t make changes to the obvious, counterproductive tendencies he has, in order to combat that reality?” Good question. I agree, but pushing out of the protective bubble of the comfort zone is a task that has proven, time and time again, to be easier said than done. I have some pretty powerful anxieties and irrational fears that tend to always get in the way of my progress. I don’t really understand how people meet strangers and fall in love with them, or how to get dates with girls I don’t know. I feel as though I always find myself in disbelief of girls’ attraction to guys. Of course, straight women are as interested in men as straight men are in women, but my brain doesn’t really cooperate with that fact. I always find myself doubting that any girls I encounter could possibly be interested in going on dates or getting a boyfriend. Like, dudes suck. Why would any girl be trying to get with a guy. It’s a weird irrationality, I know, but I’ve yet to find myself in a situation with a metaphorical green light to go ahead and get serious with a girl. Of course, I might, had she not moved for college (so close).', 'Anywho, thanks for reading! For the other lonely people, don’t give up! There’s somebody for all of us, and we’ll find them eventually! Just don’t give up! -D', \"Before I proceed to answer this I don't want anyone to feel bad for me. I accepted my life and if anyone is out there feeling as bad as I am. I just want to let you know you are not alone. Over a period of 18 years nearly, becoming lonely was a process to me. There was a constant hope I had throughout. I had friends when I was young and not to mention they were constant and I was genuinely happy. I realised that I'm happy around people. I was an outgoing, happy, broadminded girl who spoke to everyone despite how they were to me I spoke to guys as well. When puberty hit everyone I know we all senses that there's something more to friendship. That's when things started to change. I was in 6th grade I had a couple of senior friends as well. Both boys and girls. I was slut shamed for the first time. I didn't know what that meant but when I started knowing the meaning if what it meant I was just devastated I never expected the genuine friends who knew me well to call me that ! My classmates, the seniors I was friends with slutshamed me because apparently I spoke to guys and It was considered flirting.\", \"Literally no one spoke to me. A couple parents asked their kids to distance themselves from me. I didn't know why. I didn't have sex or date guys I was just 11 . What does a 11 year old know and do about all this. My problem wasn't even talkable. It was something I suppressed . Slowly I just became all alone. I started really liking it . I engulfed myself and started getting addicted to staying Alone. I was never blessed to have anybody genuine. People bitched about me, stabbed me, hated me , was always rude to me and hurted me speaking the rudest words. Somewhere I realised that I was never lovable. I was also extremely mature. I had no one to talk to when u had problems, never had a shoulder to cry on, never shared my happiness to anyone. I learnt to deal with it all by myself. I somewhere felt satisfied dealing with my problems, anxieties, fears , happiness with myself. I felt no one is ever going to feel the way I feel. No one is going to feel happy for me, sad for me, or scared for me like I'm going to for myself. So I felt it is better off to be all alone.\", \"I was inexplicably kind to everyone around me because I knew how it felt to be bitched about,betrayed and hurt somebody. I learnt no matter what, it's you and just you who's going be present every second of your life. Your soul is going to undergo every moment of this life you've gotten from the grace of God. I prayed god often, read scriptures told god my problem many of the people would think it's useless but I kept in peace with my soul and cleaned all that I had talking to god and talking to myself.\", \"No one cares for me. No one will ever do. I've not met a single friend over the years. Even if I did, they left me. And I don't expect more from anybody. I help them I am kind to them if they betray me, then I would just leave. No body calls me. No one considers my opinion. No one even looks at me. I go out for a coffee on the rainy days all by myself and enjoy it. I admire all those friends at cafe coffee day or starbucks . I don't envy them. I just feel happy looking at them enjoying life when they're supposed to be doing so ! Maybe I'm missing out on it maybe I'm not.\", \"But all I want to say is remember to love yourself and be proud of your existence till today :) it's a blessing. Be thankful to god that you have a family that you have the capacity to do your everyday activities. You have food to eat, you have water to drink. Read books if you are lonely they can be your best friend :) but most importantly, learn to nurture yourself. Although you are hustling being all alone don't blame yourself for it. It's okay to wait for the best for the genuine people. Mark my words. No one can love you as much as you do or go through the things like you are experiencing. Love yourself & be kind to everyone.\", \"I hope this is not depressing.I just told you what I feel going through this. It's just something I'm going through. And I'm thankful to be lonely to learn somuch by myself and that I'm capable of having myself to handle all that by myself.\", \"May life bring you genuine people and kind hearted souls to face it because that's the greatest blessing one can have.\", \"I am 22 year old computer science student which now have pivoted to Finance.

In these nine years I hardly made new friends and hardly visited new places. I have never travelled beyond 200 kms from my house. And even in my city I have been to very few areas.

And then there was another incident, where my best friend’s friend had asked for my bike and I refused to give which was immaturity on my part as I had never stayed in a hostel environment before and failed to realize how important it is to share stuff with your flatmates.

My dad used to beat the shit out of me to get better marks in maths. But I had no interest in this subject. My parents never allowed me to play with others in childhood. We were living in a small rented house and there was no water supply inside the house. The town municipal water taps were the only source of water. My parents instead of letting me play forced me to get the water came through those taps. My mother would beat me badly if I disagree to fill the water. My schoolmates never made friendship with me as I was a honest student in the class and it made them feel Im abnormal. I had crush on a girl in between(First crush). Days passed I completed my 9th standard and my family moved to another area in the same town. As I was in 10th standard I completly involved in studies and got passed with distinction.

I had to get up at 5 in the morning, get ready and reach the bus stop, catch 3 buses and got scolded in class daily for reaching late.Days passed and I deeply know I won’t survive Engineering. I couldn’t understand head and tail of the subjects. First sem results came,I failed in 4 subjects.Second sem result - again 3 subjects failed. I was depressed to the core and was living like zombie. One day my school mates created a whatsapp group which had my first crush contact too. I got her number from the group and started texting,talking day and night. I was slowly healing from depression and forgot my situation,she had a breakup and was looking for someone’s help to get over it. I confessed her I had crush on her and I was about to propose her,she had given me her fb password I didn’t know she was again going behind her ex and was using me like toy untill i logged into her fb and saw her texts with him. I called her and had a fight over phone and got brokeup with her. Inthe mean time One of my childhood friend died. My smartphone got stolen. I met with an accident got my right leg fractured. All the bad things started striking me at once. I was feeling suicidal. I had no friends to share my feelings,no one to put a hand on my shoulder on say everything is goin to be fine.

I had already lost 3 years of my life that too teenage years. Society started treating me like failure. I stopped going out of home,attending functions, locked myself in the room. One day my dad scolded me and got me admission into a local degree college for Bcom course. I had my school juniors as my seniors here. I was feeling ashamed daily to go to college. My classmates are 4 years younger than me. I had friendship with a beautiful girl and and catched feelings for her, she made me feel good and put a smile on my face after a long time. I asked her indirectly about us getting married in future she rudely said Im a short guy and she don’t like short guys at all. I was about to lose her friendship so with a fake smile hiding my pain I said I was kidding. She knew it was not a joke and started ignoring me.

My life is mostly filled with sad moments but i never blame anyone, even to my parents, even to God. I realise this is my fate.

But I really feel like I am the loneliest person on Earth. Now I gonna tell about myself. I am studying at a coaching centre in a city Where population is just 14–15 lakh. So I am preparing for jee 2020. But I don't have much good friends, and literally no best friend. And almost 0 female interaction. Fuck the things about opposite gender, I don't even have boys on the name of friends. And my hair's are too thin, that even if I water my head. It will look like an watermelon with only some seeds. Means that, my head is totally visible. And also I am fat. It was my birthday some days ago, almost no one knew about it. Just mother, father and my sis. I wanna study, but just can't sit too long. And always my phone has message of 90% and 50% data usage. This things were really haunting me. So I started to write a dairy whatever the hell comes in mind, just wrote it on… Then there is a girl in my coaching, MANSI. So charming personality and my crush. I never tried to talk to anyone, especially towards girls. Always thinking about her, then I saw fucking topper talking too her. I felt a little strange, but soon I came to know that he is her boyfriend. So I hold myself very hard. Maybe because I just falled for her very much. And of course I never talked to any girl, so there was even no chance here too. Days passed and nothing new in my life. And my father and mother also have a lot of expectations as always. I thought this was the depression, so I tried hard to avoid all the things in my daily cycle. And my studies were like normal. Then after some days I thought that I am okay now. I was feeling awesome. So I thought there will be same people like me out there. Even now I don't have any friends. My classmates think that I am just a hritik roashan from koi mil Gaya. Means to say that, they were making fun of me. And of course this lead to my rude behavior with them. So I started an Instagram handle, to talk to people anonymously. So that I can know there pain and will try to make them feel better and off course to solve there problem. But I put in bio that I am girl. And started commenting on meme pages, so that people could notice it. And at the sudden, many people camed to tell there problem. Many boys and some girls. And 80% were about there realtionship. Like there ex cheated on them or they think that they are cheating on them. I started to talk to them and spend 25 hrs on insta in just 4 days. I was feeling very strange at that time. Then a girl messaged me that she is young and still studying and her father dead. They are living in a rented house and financially broke. She was asking for my help, and I didn't knew how to help her. This touched my heart very much that I can't really help people. So I stopped it. But again I am lonely. My phone usage is around of 7 hrs daily. Don't really know what to do. I watched many web shows from got to the 100. And also all from the tvf. But still feeling very tired all the time. And yes it is still the case. I forgot that I have a life. That I was a champion at my school till 10 th. And literally saying, MERE DIMAG KA BHOSADA HO GAYA HE. And don't know what to do . Soon after 2 months there will be jee and new year. So I am gathering my broken pieces together to be motivated. And also to study. I really don't know what to do, some songs makes me feel better for some time. And day dreaming always is the case. I even I don't have a good sleep. It's just my story. And I really think there is nothing much interesting left in my life. Just as usual things and nothing new. I also want friends, a group of friends where there will be girls there. And I could say I have bestie, a group of friends. But no god doesn't want this. So thank u for reading this boring answer, and really sorry if u think that I wasted ur time.

My husband is not the same man whom I dated or fell in love with head over heels. He's a changed man now! To begin with, 4 years ago my then boyfriend(now husband) was not earning enough to start a family. But yes! He made blind promises to me that he would gradually grow. I loved him whole-heartedly so I agreed to marry him despite all opposition from both sides of our respective families. My parents were in complete denial of this union, but I somehow convinced and promised by parents that I would stand by him through thick and thin and motivate him to success. Henceforth, I was successful to an extent, my husband's salary grew from a nominal 20k INR and now he earns close to 1.5–2 lakhs INR per month. But this wasn't easy. The road to success was rocky. In 4 years of my marriage, my husband was thrown out of a job three times. Everytime he loses job within an hour’s notice i.e., unemployed from the very next day. The first and second time he lost his job, I stood rock solid by him. All his friends would often tell him about how supportive I've been to him. But time and again, the more I do for him, the more he expects from me and feels it is a part of my responsibility as a wife. Nonetheless, he lost his job for the third time now and I'm emotionally drained. He never discusses why he loses his job everytime. To the extent, he never tries to work on his weaknesses too. He is dead stubborn. He never asks me even if I'm lying ill on the bed. He feels this is all sham. Lastly, he has never done anything for me till this date. We never go out. We didn't go for our honeymoon yet. Reason being he cannot afford it, as per his words. Neither is he interested in having a sexual or physical relationship with me. I always wanted to start a family, but he always avoids it stating that he ain't earning enough or is feeling sick. His negligence towards this relationship has left me in utter disgust and loneliness. To my dismay, my husband often says I'm responsible for his misfortune and he wants a legal separation from me soon. Hearing such harsh words broke all my trust and feelings for him. Hell broke loose, I have failed miserably and I have no place to go. I don't want to trouble my aging parents with my emotional breakdown. I went against their wishes to marry this insensitive guy. I feel suicidal sometimes, but stop myself from self-harm. If I do, my husband has nothing to lose, it's a huge LOSS for my parents. I love them very much and can never think of hurting them. I know someday I'll be gone and turn to ashes.

I get birthday wishes from my parents and WhatsApp groups where someone posts it publicly that it's my birthday.

I stopped talking to her because I couldn't say yes(because she was fat). Didn't want to depress her by saying no(imagine if I was in her place!). Before graduating, we did talk for a while(very awkward). It was so long ago that I don't even remember what I said, but I think she got the message. That's the end of it.

I did appreciate the company, but the friendship became stale by the end of 2 years. There was a guy whom I considered as my best friend in the begining, and we used to dream of getting alloted the same IIT, hostel and dorm room. Yeah, we fantasized that shit. He was way smarter than me and I feared we wouldn't be neck to neck 20 years down the line. Academics and IIT became very very important. Occasionally we went to movies and sometimes I'd enjoy being in a gang, but mostly no. By the end, I hated everyone. It wasn't like people wanted to be friends with me. They just ignored me(was something wrong with me? Why do people like me in the begining and hate me later?). Sometimes that made me focus more on JEE, and sometimes that made me depressed. I'd dismiss all those emotions in the hope that I'd get into a good IIT and that'll be the end of all my miseries (including my parents who didn't make it easy for me). Captain America civil war came out while I was still here. We were huge marvel fans and I wanted to go to the movie with everyone else. I call up my “best friend” to make plans for the movie. He says “no dude, I'm going with my friends. I don't want to go with you”. He knew I had started to ignore him (JEE shit) and he despised me for ruining our friendship. I did manage to go with the gang, but watching that movie on Tony fight Steve was hard(remember “So was I”?) I knew this was the end of it and I had blown it once again. No best friends till now. Ok here comes IIT.\", \"IIT: turns out none of us did well and we weren't getting an old IIT. My “best friend” from the previous paragraph decided to go to a new IIT(no batches yet) because it was closer to home. I on the other hand chose to go to a slightly older IIT(opened in 2009) because it'll have more people. That was it. Our paths diverged and I lost the chance to retain a friend.

I knew everyone's names, where they're from, what they're like(mean? Friendly? Fun?). Turns out while everyone was busy making forming gangs, I was getting to know everyone. So by the end, I wasn't a part of any gang. I didn't have any close friends. Or a friend for that matter. I did have 2 roommates but one was very cold and the other was always busy with his girlfriend. When he finally broke up, he decided to give me more attention. After spending a lot of time together, I decided to call him as my new best friend. Hurray! I even got a 9+ CG in the first sem.\", \"In my sophomore year that guy betrayed me(long story) and I was depressed. For real this time. I started therapy and it fixed me for a while. I couldn't forgive him. He didn't know how big a deal making a best friend is for me. It broke me. Into a million pieces. I couldn't trust anyone again. All along I was in touch with a junior from my college(back home). I would advise her about JEE and all the crap that came with it. Since I knew what JEE was all about, I discouraged her to not care about JEE when I found out that she was only doing it because her dad had asked her to(things weren't easy for her). I honestly cared about such people and the scenario they're put in. Turns out we began to like each other and we were having a long distance relationship even if we weren't ready to admit it. She helped me become emotionally mature and I helped her relax her mind. It was nice in the beginning. She didn't clear JEE and decided to drop a year. I dunno what happened, things went south and I began to hate her(I felt that she had become manipulative). We “broke up”. Stopped talking. It was ugly.\", \"Junior year: I realised how truly lonely I was when I had to take a single room because no one wanted to be around me. How did this happen again?? I thought I was making friends. Earlier when I was getting to know others, they got to know me as well. They decided not to be with me. No one. Every semester I averaged 2 depressions, but the 5th semester takes the cake. With intervews for internships going on, I think I've been through 4 this time. It just made me stronger. I learnt how to live by myself with no one other than my mind and a single room.

In my family there are 5 members ( mom dad and two brothers) and surrounding by my dad's brothers ( bade Papa, badi mummy and chacha Chachi and dada dadi). They are very creepy and they think my dad have a lot of money and they always want to money from us. And my grand parents are not loving us like others grand parents. For them money is everything. My father is very innocent. That's why everyone yells at him even his younger brother doesn't respect him. That's make me very sad even I can't do anything. And my mom used to say leave this house. We can live anywhere where we find peace. And my dad is government employee his income is 40k per month which is enough for our livelihood even this is more than enough to a below middle class family. Whenever my uncle grand parents are abusing my dad and we ( me my mom and my brothers one is younger than me and one is elder than me) are protecting him. My dad yells at us and also beats.

Learn questions answers from series or guess paper and do coaching of compititive exams and do hard work in it not in your academics like class 10th and 12th and pass the exam and get a government job.

Always struggle to appreciate the things we have in life. I would have loved to be in your position right now. I’m a grown up man who lives in my parents house, no job, no money. Due to circumstances I’m now living in a small town surrounded by family members who all/most live literally 5 min away from our house.', 'My parents barely talk to each other, are somewhat dependent on me being home to have a good time and I have almost no privacy. I don’t have a job I can go to, to get a break from my house. I can’t travel due to money problems (even if there was no corona). I currently have about 5 girls who I can meet up for a date with, but I have nowhere to take them back without my parents finding out. Even meeting a girl and holding her hand in public in my town is a concern in case a family member sees me and spreads the word in the circle. Yup, it sucks to be in this position as an adult.', 'I have a wedding in my family coming up and I absolutely don’t want to be a part of it as I don’t really like my family due to them never having treated me with respect or true love. It is for example a very normal thing for me to be ignored by my own family members when we have a gathering. I’m somewhat compelled to attend a bachelor party/weekend soon but I would rather stay at home alone than being with those toxic family members who are totally materialistic, mean and talk behind people’s backs.', 'Although, I have never had good social skills, I have some old friends who wanted to meet up with me, but I haven’t gotten back to most of them because I currently want to feel better about myself and learn to be happy with myself before I meet up with them. I’ve realized that no one can make me happy except myself and I’m responsible for my own happiness. No external things or people can make me really happy. The other remaining couple of friends who I have met up with are basically what I see as a bunch of losers. They drain my energy and I feel bad for myself when I hang out with them. I have stopped having contact with them for a few months which I’m very happy about, plus one of them is going away and won’t be able to stay in touch so it’s perfect timing.', 'At the moment I don’t have any friends I hang out with, and I’m not depressed because of that. I don’t need people to be happy I have plenty of goals and things I want to do in life and not just big dreams, but something as simple as learning to concentrate on one thing which is so hard for someone like me, but probably one of the greatest achievements in my life when I’m able to do it. So, if you do feel bad for yourself, then remember that there are people out there like me who would love to be in the position you are in.', 'Depression and loneliness can affect anyone and I have been through several myself. I have lived alone in the past also without many people around me so I understand that it can be hard sometimes. But appreciate the things you have. But the question here is what do you want in life? Are you happy with yourself? For example, if you want more women in your life, then go out and approach them during the day, it’s as simple as that. I did online dating for almost 10 years in 3 different countries before actually getting laid haha, but after some effort into approaching women during the day, I met my first girlfriend and got laid again with other beautiful women. Life isn’t all sunshine and rainbow, it’s a mix of all seasons. However, here are a few practical tips I can give you:', 'Depression and loneliness will tell you to get in/stay in bed, with a vat of ice cream, draw the blinds and restlessly switch through the TV stations or play solitaire on your iPad or surfing the web. In the short-term these will likely feel effective. However, if you do what your emotions are telling you to do, you will certainly be more depressed and lonely as this is not a good long-term strategy for resolving depression or loneliness.', 'Instead, keep yourself warm, get outside, be around people, and build up your endurance for walking, biking, swimming, kayaking, or some other repetitive sport that is slow and gives you time to work out your thoughts and feelings. You are probably feeling bad for very good reasons such as isolation, and you are not crazy. But you do need to change behavior. Get out of the house on the weekends or before/after work.', 'You can find people with common interests through Meet Up, a place of worship, yoga studio, and simply by spending time in a coffee house on the weekends and meeting locals. If lonely or depressed you may be a bit prickly and sensitive; be kind to people you find to be prickly and set healthy boundaries (i.e., I don’t want to discuss that, let’s change the subject, I’d rather do this than that, I need to be alone right now). Are there hiking trails near you, are there people in the parks who do yoga, slackline, gymnastics, etc. (a typically welcoming group), would a book or movie club, game nights or walking group (Sierra Club for example) appeal to you, etc.? You may have to build your strength before being able to do any volunteer work - helping others is a good anti-depressant.', 'If you do stay in you are better off reading, doing a craft, talking on the phone than watching TV or surfing the web mindlessly (the exception being funny animals as for most people it peeks oxytocin, or Ellen or something inspiring). If you find yourself drinking too much your doctor can give you an alcohol antagonist to get it back under control - you can have a beer or glass of wine on these pills but anything more will make you sick.', 'Animals can have a good effect but are not replacement for human connectedness. If you aren’t up to having a pet you may offer to walk an elderly or disabled neighbour’s dog.', 'I hope that this helps some, good luck, most people find themselves in your situation at some point in life - particularly in America. We have a sick society, built on working too much for too little, spending more than earned, working during non-work hours, isolation, uncontrolled anger and rage and this certainly has an effect on all of us. So beware and take good care of you.', '(I live in Spain where festivities are weekly, random days off are frequent, we siesta, even low wage workers travel and meet friends, lovers, and mates, at non-covid times we greet with kisses on the cheek. Working class families often have vacation homes that have been in the family for generations and they use them when they want. The larger environment in many western countries is very sick with work, spending, and isolation.)', 'Hi,', 'It’s a challenging feeling to find a way to process and overcome, I know that for sure, more so I know because I lived similar to that a few years ago…I lived alone in a 29 sq.m (315 sq.ft) apartment, which I rented as a student from the local student housing association (here in Helsinki, Finland), and though I wasn’t working, I had my thesis to complete - 3d printed tennis rackets as a possible consideration for future tennis racket manufacturing, which you can find', 'here', '.', 'There were times when I found myself isolated from others, becoming a kind of recluse, being required to complete the necessary efforts before the deadline, rejecting chances to spend time with others. I would also procrastinate, and so rejecting those chances, meant that I was making the deadline that extra bit more critical, while experiencing further reinforcement of neglecting what really matters, creating cycles where I would go to bed really late, and then sleep late, and then wake up late, and the cycle would repeat! One way I interrupted these cycles was that I had learned of research that to overcome insomnia, allow yourself to stay awake as long as you can, so that you are truly physically and mentally fatigued into sleeping - I did this a few times, somewhat ironically finding pleasure in experiencing the phase of sunrise! Reducing / eliminating the coffee helps, and drinking tea helps, especially rooibos tea, acting as a kind of anti-stimulant / “anti-caffeinator”, along with camomile tea.', 'When I did have breaks, it was when I coached tennis, intermittently, or then I would go down to the nearby sports fields to move around and at least see and hear people, and maybe have small moments of striking up a conversation…The other thing that did help me was that I at least enjoyed going to sauna (most certainly a very Finnish thing to do), and more so to the local social sauna on certain days, because, hey, at least there was a chance for reducing my isolation and loneliness, and I got to enjoy the changes between hot and cold (air outside, and/or showers). Recently, more research has been found that truly helps people if they sauna, addressing the hormetic response - a bit of challenge produces “good” stress (eustress) that increases resilience in the body, while too much of a chronic challenge results in “bad”, extended stress that decreases the toughness, basically breaking you down. So, you might want to find your local sauna, but learn to find your edge of tolerance!', 'Interestingly, what helped me too get through some of my isolating circumstances, while working on my thesis on my computer, was listening to interesting online conversations between the host / interviewer and guest - plenty around on the web, so maybe that could help you to get some new ideas.', 'As I look back on this isolated time with my thesis, I realise that that period helped me get clearer on what the drawbacks, and tactics to deal with them, of committing to a degree and a thesis are, if I were to consider studying further, and become engaged with that time and energy. Knowing what invigorates me, and what keeps me inspired, along with what nourishes, strengthens, and keeps my mind-body flexible and resilient, while under the constraints of external pressures / forces / boundaries such as deadlines, would help me feel the possibilities of freedom of movement and especially experiencing meaningful connections with others, that help dampen the seriousness of life, and make life feel lighter.', 'What I wrote above was a more specific “if this then that” kind of response, but what I write below is more to do with the bigger picture of your life, questions I ask and have asked myself:', 'The questions which you might want to consider are, \"How do I turn my situation of being uncomfortably lonely, to being comfortably alone?\", and, \"What\\'s weighing me down, metaphorically and literally?\", which requires stepping away and detaching from your currently (self- and society-)conditioned way of living, in order to see it from a distance. To answer these questions, consider:', 'Taking two self-directed courses in:', '1. The history of…yourself.', 'Yes, yourself! Everyone has a history, and there must be a lot of moments that show you when you have felt much more alive, not so…? By looking at and understanding your past, while giving attention to what you have valued, you get to be in a position to change your future, by adjusting your current / forgotten values.', 'Just start with a pen and booklet or paper pieces, and see where the writing leads you to, and consider some basic drawings within you skill capacity that represent moments, which gives alternate insights.', \"How about writing a few memoirs or moments from your life you cherish, and in doing so, describing why they were significant to you, and made/make you feel alive? In looking at life as a whole, with interconnected parts, your life surely will have duller moments, so how have you gotten into them and through them, so what do they mean, now? How come you've been resilient and determined? What’s motivating you to want to be alive? This existential question is significant, because having hopes and dreams (along with how they are being repressed / suppressed ) plays a role in your way of being and habits. Consider reading Viktor Frankl’s Man’s Search for Meaning?\", \"At every moment, when we need to decide, values mixed with assumptions and biases, lead us to believe that making certain choices will give us what we need/want, and just because it may not have ‘worked out’ in the past, making a choice doesn't mean that it will have to be permanent, but maybe you needed to learn something which you hadn't been aware of before…What are the lessons to be integrated and applied into your current way of life?\", 'Living well requires attention to the small things (like the state of our bodies/minds, how language is used and what, and especially how, we communicate, and how liveable our environment is), which add up over time, and requires correction through awareness from observation, curiosity, and care, and feeling connected to others. Listen to one word a week that you use as a focus and consider how you use that one word in your daily life, as words matter.', 'This also needs to be done in conjunction of being aware that the world outside of ourselves keeps changing too, and depending on our attitudes and our levels of self-esteem how we integrate with it also affects what we believe we can do for ourselves, others, and nature. So courage is another determining factor in how we serve the environment and how we would like the environment to serve us. By understanding these more closely, you empower yourself and those around you, so consider these aspects for your past, present, and future.', 'Later, you can put these moments / notes / scribbles on your computer in a digital file, in a more orderly timeline, keep them for your records, and draw upon them in the challenging / Self-forgetting times, or then share them for others to benefit, so people can be conscious about your experiences and insights, motivations, and inspirations.', 'Having reflected upon your history and extracted the platinum and diamonds from your past (you might only consider your past as copper or silver at the moment, but your life is worth it), consider then …', \"2.

The only thing Nature requires of you is to enjoy your time… wisely! Remember to play with nature and the different elements - that way you will appreciate and likely protect nature, especially when the world is on the path towards destroying it, because of a certain lack of appreciation, through loss and lack of context of one’s own behaviours and impact, by only knowing the city life (information about nature is not knowing - to know is to be engaged appropriately directly with the environment and fauna and flora within it).', 'Get up close with nature, like when I was in South Africa in 2018, by this vulture.

The way I see it is that had you been surrounded by wise(r) people, maybe you would not have gone through what you had.\\nSo, why not “Become what you needed for those who might be needing.”?]', 'You just might want to consider, in summary: What do you value, intrinsically, to experience more of that, such that your intrinsic / intangible values connect to extrinsic / tangible values? What emotions / feelings / thoughts (an initialism I just call EFTs) do you want to experience? Importantly, what do you want others to experience too, with you? What obstacles come between you and experiencing those EFTs - think of a piece of land you want to get across to - what is this bridge you want to cross, but do you still need to build it, repair it, or destroy it to make a new one? Remember, you can also look for collaborators with this bridge, some call them helpers, guides, teachers, coaches, therapists, business owners, leaders, friends, lovers, soulmates, so they come in different forms. How can you take responsibility for your EFTs, such that you can transform them into your favour? What kind of movements can get you going? If you’re not sure how to describe those emotions and feelings you would like to experience, check out the interactive', 'Emotions and Feelings Map', 'I made recently.', 'By the way, I’ve also known that an EFT also means Electronic Fund Transfer (being able to transfer money between bank accounts), so if you were to think in that term, what do you feel like doing, in such a way that will allow you to transfer Energy (another word synonymous with electronic) towards you? Funnily enough, music and dance came to my mind, so EFT stands for Electro-Funk-Trance in my mind! :D What music do you listen to that gets you and your soul moving and shaking? :) What do you sing to? What words of your own can you sing to? I find of late that music, singing, humming, rapping, whistling, beatboxing, and dancing, altogether, really help the negative emotions transform into positive ones.

Find someone or anyone or more than one person that you have something in common with that you feel passionate..or if you don’t like that word use “very strongly” or “very strong feeling” about. But it has to be specific. Say you love dogs, you worship dogs, you think dogs are the best thing in the world and they should be treated without abuse and as good as people, etc. You have strong feelings about dogs. Now, you can meet someone who likes dogs, may even have a dog but their feelings are not as strong as yours are about dogs. Yes, you have dogs in common but you do not have that passion or “very strong feeling” in common. And so they may not be a good match. Your passion “very strong feeling” is important to you. To them, your passion “very strong feeling” about how great dogs are is not going to be something they relate to or experience.

He’d often rather sleep on the floor than on the couch next to me or up on my bed.', 'I like quiet. It’s comfortable. People stress me out in a large group. Or too long in even a small group. I never feel like I belong.', 'Never', '.', 'Once, I was at a spiritual retreat in Colorado. I had made a small name for myself on the organization’s forums before the retreat. Of the 450 or so men at the retreat, I probably had communicated with at least 60–70 of them through the public posts as well as private messaging. We shared life together. We shared struggles together.', 'At the retreat, I felt increasingly lonely as I was inundated with guys of various ages and life experiences coming to shake my hand, introduce themselves, and thank me for whatever words of affirmation and hope I extended with them.', 'And yet I was desperately lonely. So lonely, I apologized to one gentleman who had wanted to meet me, told him I’d catch him in a bit, but I needed to go for a walk. Now, I’m obese. Not simply overweight. I do not walk. But I needed to compose myself and recenter, find my grounding in the crisp air of the mountains at 12,000ft.', 'I am loneliest when I’m in a crowd and the noise that I’m not good enough and that I do not fit in is so loud - I just cannot shut down those thoughts. I’m desperate to do so.', 'And yet, when I’m not lonely, I don’t feel the need to fit in.', 'Fitting in', 'is about shame. Simply', 'belonging', 'is about inner resolve and strength. I want more of that.', 'Yea, in some ways, but that’s life as an expat.', 'You miss your old friends, family, own culture. I miss being able to meet people and just be completely open and expressive without being weird or seen as someone who is really breaking the mold.', 'The worse part was having close family members pass away while being abroad, that really hurts because you weren’t able to see them before they went so much or there was a lot of time taken away that you would’ve have had you lived closer, holidays, things like that, so it’s difficult dealing with that emotional weight alone, where nobody knew those people, your family, your old life and they just see you as this person that lives where they live and who you are in the context of this reality, when for me there is another world that exists outside of this and at this point I don’t entirely feel connected to either one completely, it’s a weird limbo that can come after living abroad for a while.', 'Also, the Nordic cultures are nice and friendly, they’re good people but they’re not the warmest or most affectionate people in the world and it takes time to get close to people, emotionally and physically, unless it’s like sex and sauna, those things are awkwardly excluded from the “being close” list of things you can do that are not awkward but really should sort of be more so if you compare them to how difficult everything else socially works.', 'I also miss the fuck out of hugs and touch. Just being able to embrace someone without it being really awkward or creepy. In Los Angeles I could practically tell a stranger or someone that I just met I needed a hug and they’d likely give me a big one, assuming it wasn’t awkward, social skills go a long way there and the social opportunities are limitless where in the culture I’m in you could never do that, it might happen or be possible but it’d be awkward and a real eye-opener if it did.', 'The funny things, the people who I met early on, while still acting American, always give me these big hugs automatically and it even throws me off now that I’ve gotten used to not giving or receiving good hugs. If it wasn’t for me introducing them to that they would have never done it, so it’s really nice, but those opportunities are here and there.', 'Romantically, of course you can get hugs and affection, touch but for me it’s not the same. Everything is just bottled into that kind of intimacy where it has to be under that context, of like being romantically involved with someone. I think touch and affection is really important, I never realized that before living abroad but it really does make a difference, at least for me.', 'When you can from a place that is essentially alien to most of the people you are around, day after day, it does feel emotionally lonely, even in terms of expressive, it’s just no the same and you never feel like you get the same satisfaction anymore, it’s not the full spectrum.', 'Even dating Nordic women, I’d probably never half to talk about 50 percent of the things I would have to as I would with an American woman and that’d be perfectly fine and normal to her. So sometimes you shutdown or don’t talk about things more than you normally would or express, since typically they’re not used to hearing, talking or expressing those things with each other, it’s not “normal” or typical.', 'Yes.', 'Moving abroad to a foreign country to pursue my education is a enormous step for me, a homestuck girl . More so I am an introvert.', 'The first two weeks of my new life in the new country I feel really lonely. I have friends that also fly to the same country, but we are not that close. My best friend stayed in my home country, half a world away, my family are also there.', \"It only got worse. I feel like something is missing in my heart, like when your favourite character in a book/movie that you love with all of your heart died. I still smile, but it's out of politeness. Inside I longed for human contact, a deep conversation, an emotional bond.\", \"I became numb, a defence mechanism that I have. Which doesn't actually help with my situation where I have to connect with people. I call my friend, who lives in another country, more often.\", 'Even now I still feel emotionally lonely. Although I guess it is normal since it has only been two months since I moved abroad.', 'yes. i tend to feel like i am when i refuse to surrender and talk to my friends and family about my emotions. i’m too mean to myself and i forget to prioritise my own well being since i focus too much on making sure everyone else around me is okay. i could be sat in a crowded room of people yet still feel empty.', 'i think one of the main reasons why people cannot expose the way they feel is because we all believe that everyone is happy which makes us feel very weak and vulnerable. since we are convinced that everyone else is comfortable with their own life, we begin to feel bad about ourselves because we question why we don’t live a certain life where there are no problems. however, everyone is going through something. everyone is suffering. we’re just all too scared to speak up because we’re unaware that everyone else is also insecure. it’s a chain reaction but we have to learn how to break that negative chain so that we can get the help we need and encourage the people around us to do the same. that way, we become a lot more open and accepting when it comes to dealing with problems that way, more people will get the help they need and will become better people for others and more importantly for themselves.', 'Yes. I think it’s fair to say that it’s normal to be “emotionally” lonely at times, but we shouldn’t stay that way for a while because that’s when it becomes unhealthy.', 'I observed that I get emotionally down when I am super stressed and tired. I learned to find ways on how to get myself centered again every time. I take day offs from work, get more rest, exercise, hang out with friends, stay connected with my family, read books, listen to podcasts, watch movies, drum (because I’m a musician), or volunteer in church. I also pray and keep a journal.', 'It’s about giving myself some time to breathe and process my experiences, so I can appreciate the things that I have, reevaluate myself and set new goals. It also helps clear my head and put things in order (mentally) and gives me more psychological space to think straight. Like machines, after too much use, we can also “overheat” and we also need to recharge. So that’s what I strive to do.', 'Yes, occasionally!', 'My parents live thousands of miles away, one best friend is in the same country as I currently live in but across the coast. The other one lives in Thailand and I haven’t seen her since March 2016.', 'The lack of a full-time romantic relationship means no on-demand hugs or cuddles :( I find that companionship with the right person can give you a lot of emotional strength and physical touch is a powerful ‘bad-mood buster’, as evidenced by science.', 'My brain has been deprived of dopamine, oxytocin and serotonin for way too long! There are times when I can’t remember what it feels like to be high on these chemicals :D', 'How do I help myself feel less lonely? I am thankful to have a full time job that keeps me busy, some quality friends and I love spending time with children. External distractions help and I volunteer in my spare time as well.', 'We all have moments of weakness - if you are able to find hope and warmth in the darkest of corners, the ‘emotionally lonely’ phase won’t last forever. This too shall pass :)', 'I wish I could hug someone.', 'I’ve had a rough couple of days and I’m surrounded by people who don’t speak my language. Nobody is fluent in mine either. I can’t cry or rant to anyone around me because they won’t understand.', 'This is going to sound really pathetic, but I miss human touch. I hurt my boyfriend and I can’t hold him and tell him I didn’t mean it. He lives 9,000 miles away. I can’t hug my best friend and cry into her shoulder, she also lives half a world away. I have nobody.', 'In life abroad, times are mostly good. But when they’re bad, they’re', 'reeally', 'bad.', 'Yes, it happens when I’m just tired, bored and it feels like I have nobody to talk to. This feeling also comes when I’m in wrong crowd, where I don’t fit because people sometimes don’t match my interests. Also, it happens whenever I cry, that time I feel the loneliest and weak. But after crying it out I get up again and feel okay. Because life continues and those feelings don’t have to last :)', \"I’m guessing you mean a sense of loneliness even when in the company of others…..right? I don't suffer much with this, though I recognize it, because I have friends and family enough with long term and deep connections to me, so that I don’t feel isolated from intimate connections. It’s a lifelong process, to collect around you the people who you feel are deeply connected to you. As an only child, I didn’t feel lonely, but did want siblings, or something close to that, around me for life, so set about gathering them over the years. We are still together, even though living far apart, the feeling of “family” is still there through shared experiences and philosophies.\", 'All of the time. A product of my own doing.', \"I really have to work on realising that I am worthy of being happy in the day to day life. I set some goals. I do myself up right. I hemp someone else and not expect to be paid back. It's a gift. Put good out, get good back.\", 'I used to be. That changed dramatically when I got my dog.', 'I also found that by working on wikiHow since 2016, and since I found Quora in the last few months, I don’t feel lonely anymore. Helping people by answering questions, and doing other writing and editing has made a huge impact on any feelings of loneliness that I had.', 'I think we all occasionally want to have human contact, yet I am really not lonely. I like time being independent and by myself. I will call a friend, talk with them, read a book or even sit with my cat if I feel any unhappiness. I think I was emotionally lonely as a teenager but that may simply be the angst of the age.', \"I used to be. When younger and feeling like an unwanted intrusion into my mom's and sister's life.\", 'My husband was my greatest cheerleader and so was our son. They knew I was hurting and their encouragement and support from them and my doctor and some of my extended family I went for it.', 'They all are the world to me!', 'Not anymore. God and I have a very good relationship and I know that there is no judgment from God. He / She simply knows me and my actions. What is to judge?', 'I do feel a distance from many other humans because they seem to be flailing through life playing hit and miss emotionally. it is the nature of this realm.', 'The energies have been intense.', 'yes, quite often.']\n"

I have managed to just blur into the background. - Quora', 'What you are feeling is completely normal. The quarantines many have been subjected to have revealed quite a bit about them and their relationships—and lack of relationships. People who have always struggled with making meaningful connections, establishing personal relationships, and making friends are either living lives that haven’t really changed much, because they have always spent most of their time alone, or they are now living lives in which their illusions of friendship and connection have been completely stripped away. It’s in bad times like these when thinking people start to do some real soul-searching about their relationships and their lives. For many people, the mandatory quarantines have revealed just how isolated and alone they really are. You didn’t ask for advice, but please consider calling the few people with whom you have spent some time. Use this time to really connect with people whom you may not normally connect with. Call or email that person you only see at work who gave you his or her number but whom, for whatever reasons, you never called. Call that person who gave you his or her number while you were having a drink at the bar or drinking coffee at the coffee shop that you never called. Call that acquaintance you rarely call and who rarely calls you.', 'If there is no one you can think of or you are brushed off, which can happen, really get to know yourself and appreciate your own company. Of course this sounds trite and like vapid psychobabble about “self love,” but learning to like your own company and working on yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally while in isolation will help you get through not only the quarantine but also the loneliness you are rightfully feeling and that has more than likely been a part of your life for a very long time. Go inward. Find out whom you really are. Read. Exercise. Go outside and start walking and jogging. If the parks are open, walk in the park in nature. Order a jump rope online and use it every day. Fill gallon jugs with water and lift them like weights, if you don’t own any dumbbells. Do squats, lunges, and push ups until you are exhausted. The key is to focus on yourself completely, which can only really be accomplished when you are alone. If you’re not in a romantic relationship, this is a good time to join a dating site even if you’re not really interested in dating right now. You may find out that there are plenty of people feeling just as alone as you do, who would love to feel less so, and who would love to talk to you.', 'Maybe it’s cause you are isolated that the feeling is intensified. Why do you concern yourself with how many people care about you? If you have some people that care that’s great, but you don’t need a lot of people in order to feel like you have value. You are valuable but you haven’t really discovered why yet.', 'It’s easy to think that a lot of people should like you in order for you to feel good about yourself, and if they don’t then there', 'MUST', 'be something wrong with you. But once you let go of this idea that you need lots of attention and acceptance to have value then you stop caring. You create your own sense of self-worth not dependent on others opinions. Don’t forget people will think many things about you that might not be true, but they just have that inaccurate perception of you. People are judgemental and pretty nasty when they talk trash about you behind your back giving everyone the wrong impression of you. You can’t really control it, or how people see you. So you have to let go of trying to fit into their mold, and realize there’s nothing wrong with you even if some people don’t like you. It’s okay because you can’t please everyone and so you should stop trying. Just be you, and be respectful and people will come around naturally as they see the good in you.', 'Loneliness was at epidemic levels before Covid-19.

Schools, teachers, and parents can help and support you on your journey but you have to be curious and engage the material.

Call the Pastor and ask him if he knows anyone that likes the same things you do and if they would be phone or chat buddies. You are not the only one I am sure there must be some local groups in you area that might have something going on that you can volunteer for if you feel comfortable that could help you get out of the house, like maybe an animal shelter or such.

However, it is not normal (healthy) to feel that way for an extended period of time - say more than a month or two.

What should I do to overcome such a situation? - Quora\", 'It sounds to me like you are sitting at home waiting for somebody to come over, knock on your door, and “like you.” ..That’s not how the world works. It never has, and it never will - for anybody.', 'Do you think I’m wrong? Let’s test it. When was the last time you saw somebody sitting alone, moping, and looking miserable…and you thought to yourself: “Gee, I’m going to go over and LIKE that guy!” … “He’ll be my new best friend!”', 'Friendship is reciprocal. if you want to “have” friends, you have to “be” one. Not sit at home and wish somebody cared about you. They never will, do you know why? ..because they are “Busy” caring about people that help them, love them, care about them, do thing with them, join them, talk to them, encourage, challenge, teach, play with, and want to be with them. They don’t have the time nor the interest to knock on your door and see what you’re “grumping & whining about” tonight. They are busy with life, doing things that they find interesting, with people that also find those things interesting. They are laughing, joking, playing, and being happy. Sure, they make mistakes, have spats, fall down, even get mad at each other sometimes. It’s called “Life,” and it’s part of figuring out whether you have feathers of fins. It’s exploring limitations, personality types, activities, and preparation for adulthood. They’re not hanging around the house waiting for somebody to care about them, they are out experiencing things, meeting new people, trying new ideas, talking. interacting, & socializing.', 'That is precisely the medicine that YOU need. You need to stop feeling sorry for yourself and get into life. Go where 15 year old teens go, learn what they are into, ask if you can hang out with them, go places with them, and start to be part of your own age group. Interact. At east “Try”…even if at first you fail, and they laugh at you, so what? You’re learning, you are with people, you have someplace to go, and you are improving your social skills. It won’t be long before the others in the group will consider you a member of the pack. …yeah dude, they will “care” about you. That’s how it works. To have friends, you have to be a friend.', 'I ask you to look back on what you’ve been doing so far, and how well that has worked out for you. If you do nothing differently, nothing changes. If you expect a different result, you have to do something different. Otherwise, don’t be depressed by the results that you didn’t get ..from the effort that you didn’t put in. Get up, put on your clothes, go find those friends you’ve been …waiting on to find you.', 'It sounds like you’ve realized and accepted this. I really think that is the first step. I’m 15 too and it took me a while to accept that I have depression but once I did things honestly became easier. I was able to realize that I’m different and that that’s okay. I’ve felt different my whole life. I feel lonely all the time and I too talk to myself.', 'I really wish that I had someone I felt like I could talk to who would just listen to me and not judge or say useless things like, “It’s gonna be okay.” Deep in my heart I know it’s true but really it doesn’t help in the moment. Now I realize why that never seemed to help other people. Anyway, I would say, “Don’t worry. You’ll find the right person soon who will finally just get you,” but I don’t know that so I won’t. I guess all I can say is try to love yourself (I know it’s hard and that is probably actually a pretty useless thing to say too) but I know for a fact that even if you feel like you are alone in dealing with this and that absolutely no one knows how you are feeling, I can say you are wrong. I care and I wish I could help. And so do so many other people. Even some you haven’t met yet. (If I can help you let me know how because you are really the only one who knows what you need.) Plus there are people who dedicate their lives to helping people (something I hope to accomplish someday.)', 'I don’t know if this helped at all. I hope it did and I guess I just really hope that you know I am here for you and I understand. Sometimes that’s just all you need to hear and realize. That someone out there cares.

Sometimes the teen years are just a challenging transition time, and sometimes feeling this way is a sign that there's a bigger issue going on. Hopefully they can help you sort through what you're feeling, or at least listen.\", \"Depression can feel extremely lonely, even when you're surrounded by people, and even when you're with people who genuinely care about you. If you think this might be depression, try to work on talking to the people you do know, even about mundane things. It might not seem helpful at first, but it can be helpful to have people be able to notice when you are off. If you don't have a group of friends or acquaintances in place, are there any activities you can join in school or the community? Clubs or teams? I know that personally, even when I had zero desire to be where I was, going through the motions of doing activities in groups forced me to be safe.\", \"Therapy can be incredibly helpful for learning how to deal with the feelings of isolation, but can be hard to start when you're young without parental support. If you have that, awesome! Otherwise keep it in the back of your mind for down the road.\", 'Lastly, it scares me so much to read some of the answers to this question because, for someone who might be struggling with depression, being told to just be positive or get over it can push them further down that hole. It reinforces the idea that they are somehow defective for not being able to \"snap themselves out of it\". No one would say the same thing to someone with diabetes or a heart defect- \"just try harder not to have a problem with your heart\", \"just snap yourself out of those pancreas problems\". Please don\\'t do that to someone struggling just because you don\\'t understand their particular issue.', 'Hey Dear, I hope my answer will help you with the situation.', 'First of all,what you need to understand is that this is very common thing during adolescence.You are in transitional period, so the hormonal changes or hormonal imbalances bring about psychological effects along with physical changes.Mood swings, moodiness, loneliness, identity crisis, irritability, uncertainity,inferiority complex are some common problems during these years.Teenage is highly mentally challenging and at this time we are not “mature” enough to handle life.Peer pressure and communication gap with parents worsen the situation.', 'No matter whatever the reality is, you will only feel down and unwanted.You will always feel the need for love and attention as you think no one cares for you.You will feel like a loser in life,discriminated, self esteem will comedown and blah blah.. but guess what? this is something that everyone has faced,is facing and will keep facing as teenage is all about these.We all survived and you will too,so help yourself instead of thinking negative as your life is precious.', 'You can also enroll yourself in some classes,it will be a great help for you.', 'Enjoy life.', 'At this age, it is okay to feel like this because there are a lot of hormonal changes in the body. Plus you get a different perspective of people around you and they also start looking at you differently. For example, if you are a boy - suddenly everyone would start telling you that you are big enough now to take care of yourself, do your work, earn your pocket money etc. On the other hand, if you’re a girl - You’ll get a lot of comments on how to talk, what to wear, whom to talk etc. And these communication are over and above your routine study and life. The feeling of “nobody cares about me” usually comes when we don’t follow “their” norms and try to lead our lives our way because “they” think this chap is not interested and they leave us.', 'To overcome this situation there are few practical approaches that’ll certainly help.', 'I’m sure if you practice it, you’ll come out of loneliness well and the world around you will start liking you and following you.', 'And yes, in case you’re interested in to learn about life from real life stories, you can read “God Is Not Fair?” by Vivek Sharma available on amazon, flipcart and at leading book stores in India.', 'All the best!', 'This is the best thing that happened to you. I want it desperately. I have friends and most of the time I hang out with them doing nothing useful, roaming here and there without any reason, trash talking and all other shit. I haven’t done anything in my life which I’m proud of because I’m not a productive person so far. Being with friends is addictive because it is easy you don’t have to do anything and now I’m looking for easy things in my life.', 'Now lets come to your situation you are 15 and don’t have friends that means you have a lot of time I’m assuming you are not wasting your time on social media or in front of PC playing games. You have opportunity to do something meaningful with your life. You can start reading books other than academics also trust you will love them and you won’t miss friends. Toughest thing in the world is being with yourself if you are comfortable being alone you will never feel sad or anything like that and talking to yourself is good thing till I know because I somewhere read that highly intelligent people talk to themselves.

When you’re 15, it feels permanent and like it can’t be changed or like it can’t be fixed when it absolutely can be changed and can be fixed. In my local area, we are having a major major problem with teen suicide and I find that teens have a tendency to look at things as though they are permanent and unchangeable. Everything that you have described can be changed. A lot of people will tell you how to think and how to feel, they will just tell you what to do to fix it but you can take things into your own hands and by asking a question on here, you are taking things into your own hands. You can educate and empower yourself. You can try new things and see if they get you a different result. What do you want? I promise there is a way to get it. Maybe start getting information on how to make friends, how to beat depression and so on.

This is because their bodies are changing hormonally. It would be advisable for parents to exercise patience and restraint during this phase of adolescent growth however it doesn’t always happen.

The answer gets a bit long, but trust me, you'll get what you want by the end of this answer.\", 'I had six friends in my first year of college. We had a great time together. We used to go out together, talk a lot, and help each other out.

It felt like it was all coming true.', 'I broke it off with all six of them in second year.', 'I\\'ll spare you the details, but I\\'ll tell you this—I realized over time that what seemed to be an awesome start, a perfect dream, started turning into a nightmare—I started feeling miserable in their presence as I got to know that they all talked bad things about me behind my back, and that they never really liked me. It was all pretentious—our so called \"friendship\" was a lie—and it took me by surprise for some time. I tried to change myself for', 'them', \", I tried being more caring, I tried being more helpful, I tried being less judgmental. Nothing worked.

Now, for the first time in college, I had no one to go out with. I had no one to accompany me. Just some months ago, I had had six people—I was happy and having fun. But now, I was alone, with no one to give a shit about me. I used to check for places one could eat alone at, and I found', 'Subway', 'was the place for me. Every Saturday evening, I would drag myself out of my room and go alone to', 'Subway', 'to have a sub and come back alone to nothing. No one was waiting for me. No one was expecting me.

We were very good friends, we used to hang out together every time I got back home. But when I was in college, it was different.

I couldn't understand what to do.\", \"I started having nostalgic feelings about those times with those old friends of mine, but I remained strong and did not let myself be dictated by my emotions. I knew one thing for sure—there were reasons why I left those people. I was miserable in their presence. Had that continued, I would have ended up even more depressed and messed up.

I stopped going out for dinner on Saturdays now; I'd just skip dinner and lay in my bed. Slowly, this laziness started diffusing into my life, and I started losing the zeal to do anything new. That being said, I always remained punctual for classes, and did my assignments on time; I scored well in exams—I did all the necessary things, but never did anything apart from that. Slowly, I lost track of news, current affairs, etc. I had started writing a diary in first year; I pretty much left that too.

And soon, I got over them. I no longer thought about them, I no longer wanted to go back to them, and be friends with them again. I had a new life, and I had come to terms with it. In between, my relationship with my two best friends back home dwindled as I felt they had progressed with their lives, but I knew I had to keep them in my circle, and so, I called them up from time to time even if they didn't call me.

Cooperation is important, but if your teamates are not so diligent and industrious, who should u rely on? The answer is yourself.\\n•So let's say that u feel lonely. It's not a big deal. Don't give a damn about it and get down to do something. Do u have a dream or something u like? Just go for it. If u say, oh that costs a lot, oh that's too hard for me. Then u can turn to Quora.

U know, if u r really good at something, of course there will be someone asking u for help.

One can be alone without being lonely, and one can be lonely in a crowded room. Loneliness is, therefore, a state of mind, an emotion brought on by feelings of separation from other human beings. The sense of isolation is very deeply felt by those who are lonely. The Hebrew word translated “desolate” or “lonely” in the Old Testament means “one alone, only; one who is solitary, forsaken, wretched.” There is no deeper sadness that ever comes over the mind than the idea that we are alone in the world, that we do not have a friend, that no one cares for us, that no one is concerned about anything that might happen to us, that no one would care if we were to die or shed a tear over our grave.', 'No one felt loneliness more keenly than David. In a series of earnest, heartfelt appeals to God, David cried out in his loneliness and despair. His own son was risen up against him, the men of Israel went after him, and he was forced to flee from the city, and leave his house and family. Lonely and afflicted (Psalm 25:16), his only recourse was to turn to God and plead for mercy and God’s intervention (Psalm 25:21) because his only hope was in God. It is interesting to note that the word “lonely” is never used in the New Testament to describe people. In the New Testament, the word “lonely” only occurs twice and both times refers to desolate places (Mark 1:45; Luke 5:16), where Jesus moved off into the wilderness to be alone.', 'Whatever the cause of loneliness, for the Christian the cure is always the same—the comforting fellowship of Christ. That loving relationship with our Master has reassured and encouraged countless thousands who languished in prisons and even went to their deaths for His sake. He is the friend who “sticks closer than a brother” (Proverbs 18:24), who lays down His life for His friends (John 15:13-15), and who has promised never to leave us or forsake us but to be with us until the end of the age (Matthew 28:20).

Currently I’m on a vacation in Hawaii with my brother and neice so we can be at my dads and mother in laws wedding and ever since the first day of being here I’ve been feeling very off each day everytime that more of each side of the family members come into Hawaii and everyday both sides of my dads and my mother in laws family celebrate our trip together in Hawaii by going swimming, hiking, eating fancy dinners, visiting Pearl Harbor and visiting different beaches and museums. And mind you that this is my first time ever going on any trip like this and I always see stuff like this only in movies or on social media. So far for the most part it’s actually pretty fun here and I’m really enjoying the weather and views of the island, but besides the good parts of being here, I still do have my very bad ones as well. Everytime I have every little each relieve of stress from having my cheap thrills here, depression, anxiety, paranoia, and confusion always seems to find a way to get to me no matter what situation I’m in. And just like you I’m 16 years old and I’m always thinking about my past back when I never cared about stuff like this and back when I was still in middle school always hanging out with my small group of friends and in freshman. And it makes me realize how much I missed those days and sometimes I wish I could just go back and relive those moments and appreciate them more. And lately I’ve been feeling so lonely even tho I’m surrounded by so much family, so lonely that sometimes I really wish I had a girlfriend to care for and look out for and look towards too and talk too when I’m feeling alone and I just space out in my own head fantasizing about making passionate love with a beautiful girl of my dreams and I wish that those dreams can turn into reality. But I just know deep down I’ll never get a girl, period, I’ve tried so hard for the longest and it seems like I can’t even be comfortable with myself and i can’t even socialize with my own family, strangers or old friends no matter what I do or how hard I try. So how the fuck am I gonna have a girl if I can’t even do the simplest thing that any other human being can easily do. I try asking for advice from my brother, parents and other family members and they all tell me the same thing that I always try over and over and they act like I never been told the same thing before like I never tried doing what they tell me a million times, for example they always just tell me like “oh just make conversation”, “don’t be shy”, “just try not to be awkward”, don’t be nervous”, “just be yourself and talk to people” like if only they knew how hard it is done than said. And trust me I totally get that there helping me and its all out of love but it’s just that I’m a very complicated person and what they tell me to do never seems to work. It just seems that no matter what I look forward to for comfort to take away my pain of guilt, embarrassment, and depression, nothing really works for me anymore. I’ve ran out of all ends to look for when i feel sad but nothing makes me happy any more even the stuff that I use to or currently enjoy even in the slightest, it just feels nothing works for me anymore. I get I’m just a teenager still and I still have the rest of my life to live for and experience and to better myself as a person mentally and physically but to be honest I swear to god I really feel like I’ve been through a lot in life with the way my life’s been since I was a baby. I’m not gonna lie I do think about suicide when I do get to me deepest darkest areas of my heart and mind but I know I can never go through with it because I’m scared of a lot of things, things that would take me forever to talk about in words. It’s seems like too that it’s hard in any social situation or even talking to myself to translate from what’s such a perfect thought, statement, or opinion on something always comes out very differently when I talk, I know i sound weird and crazy but that’s just how I feel. Now if you’ve read this far I appreciate that you’ve took your time just to read a random strangers comment online even if you could’ve just kept scrolling or continued on with whatever other business your up to. I just hope that someone out there can learn from this or just help me out and give me some more advice, I’d be more than appreciated if someone can recognize me, and not be judgemental that’d be awesome. And I don’t wanna continue on making you people feel bad for me and I know many people all over the world are going through way worse things and I really shouldn’t feel bad about what I’m going through.

Today I spend most of my days alone and yet not lonely, because while it too me longer than I wish I discovered that as long as I do not focus on the temporary but focus on being the person I was meant to be and hold to that relationship with God I am not lonely.

Since I have a younger brother who IS bi-polar, it also helped me find a real-life support group to go to when he was first diagnosed, and it was a HUGE help. In addition, I know that during times in my life when I didn’t feel so great, it was usually because I wasn’t taking care of myself PHYSICALLY either. If I don’t eat right, exercise enough, or if I try to do too much and don’t get enough sleep, it has a big impact on how I feel mentally.

Some of the main characteristics of an intimate relationship are common interests, openness and common life challenges.\\nDuring college or high school years most of the people in a group will have the same problems. The upcoming exam which requires a lot of studying, the annoying teacher or the aggressive professor are all prOblems that friends in the same group face at once.\\nWhen a group of people face the same issues together some kind of a bond is formed between them that makes their relationship more intimate. In such a case those people talk about their common problems, think together of solutions and even help each other go through them (by studying together for example).\\nLoneliness can never appear in such an environment because each person will feel that he is on the same ship with others and nobody will hardly feel left out.\\nAfter graduation each person usually takes a different path and finds himself fighting his own unique battle. Problems become no longer common between the same group of people because each of them develops his own special ones.\\nFriends can become less connected to each other when each one of them lives a different life and this can reduce intimacy and promote loneliness. So how can this type of loneliness be ended?\\nIn such a case two things can be done. You can either share your new problems with your old friends and make sure you listen to theirs or you can make more friends at your new job to share with them what's going on in your new phase of life.\\nThe key to preventing loneliness is to find people who are fighting the same battle as you.

So I guess you can say, growing up I was rather different. From going to the Principals Office almost everyday in Kindergarten for swats, to being the Star player in Hgh School Football,I was one of a kind. I remember in the 8th Grade I so much dreaded the end of the school day bell. But maybe just maybe it was because I was different and with ADHD, that I was able to be creative enough, different enough, that my daily challenge of getting off the school grounds without the school bullies beating me up, was in some insane, sane way perfect for me. Yes some times they caught me and beat the crap out of me, but the rush I got when they didn't catch me, unexplainable! Then the many summers I had to think of so many creative ways to make kids on the block want to play with me. No one wanted to play with me! I moved around to fast, talked to fast, to rough. One summer I got all the neighborhood boys to play with me all summer by doing what they liked, playing football. But being so different I had to find someway to play football that was better then any time they played with out me. I called all over town challenging other boys to come to our part of town and play on our field. Then , me, this 5th grader started clearing a field, made Gole Post, dug holes, put the poles in the ground, found some lime and made the boundaries and teams came from all parts of the city to play. I had friends all summer long …….. for only a few summers that is. Because of my ADHD I missed the part in school that instilled the lies we are taught, that we must follow in order to have friends, good sex, success, money and power. Because I missed all the fabulous teachings, even though I was present, I never knew that if you have no friends, you are socially misfit, therefore must be depressed and a social out cast. To tell you the truth, I function better with no friends. Even as a child, a lone with no friends, I would build the coolest underground forts. Dig a big hole, put plywood as the roof, cover it with dirt, get candles and my little green army men, and fly off to a different world. Moral of the story is, if you fight yourself because of yourself you never will find out what God intended you to be .,……. yourself\", 'I understand how you feel. Couple ideas. One, to apply to your close friends; one to reach out beyond yourself.\\n\\nHere\\'s the deal: People like walking on soft ground. Think of walking on soft, fertile ground. It\\'s springtime, rain came last night, there\\'s a couple flowers here and there. Think of how it feels to walk there, then try to make accessing the best parts of you feel like that to other people.\\n\\nIt takes vulnerability on your part, at least a little, for people to want to speak to your needs... everybody wants to be asked, \"How\\'s it going? How\\'s school/work/lovelife/ family? Everyone needs hugs. Everyone needs someone to miss them.\\n\\nTry and make it inviting for people to enter into the living room of your soul. Do some thinking. Some people need a bunch of words to come close. Others, just a little plain speak will do it.\\n\\nUp your emotional intelligence in this area-n actually \"play\" or \"experiment\" with different techniques of bringing people close to you; this is my first suggestion.\\n\\nHere\\'s the other: Find someone, an elder, a handicapped person, a ill child, someone to give to.\\n\\nExample from my own life: I did this little giveaway at Christmas in the 150-unit, low-income apartment complex where my son and I live. The last family I reached out to needed a blanket for the man. But I only had enough to get the kids from the eight families we gave to, so I didn\\'t make it by Christmas. Instead, I could only visit with the gift of a little musical snow globe then get the blanket later.\\n\\nI went by the apartment; knocked three times, no one was home.\\n\\nI exited left, down the stairs to visit another family. Lo and behold, here\\'s the wife just coming in. I say hi, make sure I have the right person. Is Brian home? \"No,\" she said, \"I\\'m so sorry, but Brian just passed away this morning. I just got done making all the arrangements for the body.\"\\n\\nI looked closer and saw the ordeal of the last 24 hours on this petite brunette\\'s face. I could see the tension and fatigue under her eyes, around her shoulders, and in the very frame of her body. I said I had something, did she want me to come in now?\\n\\nShe said yes. In 20 or so minutes, I found out we both loved Jesus; that her\\' husband\\'s deer skull and dragon bugged her and she was going to get rid of them; that she had brothers from her family and his coming in to help her thin things out. She cried her first couple tears at the home where she lived with her husband of eight years unalone; she got hugged; she got prayer and helped pray. And she made a friend, because she let me be there for her, and I wasn\\'t, for that minute, useless. All because I was late but kept trying anyway.\\n\\nGod works in us, in our friends, in our enemies, in a very mysterious way.\\n\\nYou may be more important to those friends than you know. They may be thinking you\\'re above them or something odd. Maybe you just ask them, \"Do you have a second to ask me how I am?\" Maybe they then think worse. Or maybe you find a real friend.\\n\\nThe lady called me a few times over the next few weeks, usually at night, when she ws getting lonely, to tell me mostly good news. Yesterday, six weeks now since Brian passed, this youthful looking woman my age came by yesterday because my phone was off; she came by with a nice guy who has been helping her not be alone; she came by with a smile, her lively dark brown eyes alert to her new life alone. She brought the \"spirit\" of friendship with her, the kind I used to enjoy so much in high school before all my weaknesses took over and ruined my life.\\n\\nToday, I think of how I had something special to tell her about something girls like to talk to each other about (what else, but a guy...), and how I had to tell her to the side that I had something to tell her. Her coming by, seeing the spark of her life growing, even now, it\\'s making me smile.\\n\\nSo, if you read down this far, you\\'ve got enough time: Go find a few people, maybe even just one, to whom you can give unconditionally for their sake. Sowing a seed that is unconditional will make you feel good, and you will start looking for other ops to get that good feeling again. This will make the loneliness fade.', 'My ministering to that little gal, just \"happening\" to be there RIGHT when she got back from making final arrangements for her mate, was part of God\\'s plan for me to not be so lonely either.

I mean, seriously, what does it take to stop and visit someone?', \"If you are not a mean spirited person I would highly suggest getting a Golden Retriever. The reason I mention the mean spirited thing is really for your own protection. Because if I ever saw you abusing a dog I would have to really mess you up. But if you are a kind and gentle person, having a dog can really turn things around for you. It doesn't have to be a Golden Retriever, any dog will do, but Goldens are void of any meanness and just about as fun loving as any dog could be. There are some Idiots out there that say dogs are incapable of smiling. I know this to be false, and so does anybody else who's been met at the door by a Golden. But all this may just sound like unproven theory to you. So here are some things to think about. By getting a dog you would be responsible for the life of another. And there is nothing that can snap you out of the doldrums quicker than knowing something is going be hungry or feel suffering unless you do something about it. But this only applies if you are a kind person. Also, by having a dog, you would be forced to get out of the house to walk it. And it has been scientifically proven that fresh air and movement help against depression. And when outdoors with your dog, you are definitely going to be stopped and talked to by other dog lovers, thus affording you an opportunity to meet new and interesting people. Now I have been running on the assumption that you don't already have a dog. If I am wrong and you do have one, then all I can say is you need to pull your head out of your ass and go hug it and look at it for what it is and what it can be. A dog can and will be the most loyal friend you can ever hope to have. It will love you and never once judge you. In fact, it craves your love. So think about that and go discuss it with your Mom. Explain to her, honestly, about how you are not happy. Show her your question that you wrote here. She's your Mom and she loves you, she almost certainly doesn't want you to be sad. If it's a matter of a landlord not allowing it. You could call your dog a service dog. It is illegal for anyone to ask for proof, and you wouldn't be lying anyway because it would be serving you in your fight against sadness. Anyway, if this is the route you choose to take, please remember to be kind to the dog. And in the big picture of things, your going to be alright. So don't worry too much and allow the good things to happen. They are all around you, sometimes it just takes awhile before you recognize them. Peace to you!\", \"I'm sorry you're feeling lonely. I know that's not a good feeling. Are you feeling lonely because you don't have any friends, or is it something else? If you're looking to make friends, you may have to put in a little effort. Do you play any sports or are you a member of any clubs? Those can be great ways to meet people who share your same interests. Another thought is to volunteer. There are tons of organizations and I would venture to guess that all of them wouldn't mind having another volunteer. Volunteering is a great way to meet people who care about the things you care about and to make a difference, as well. One other thing I would mention is reading. Reading is good because it something you can do entirely on your own. By reading, you can basically enter another's world. In essence, reading is the kind of escape. I would suggest that you isolate yourself entirely, but really might be a good way to help you when you're feeling especially lonely.

But, in the long term, learn to love yourself and have a good time on your own. That helps more than anything! Loneliness isn’t about being alone. It’s about feeling like no one has your back; but that is just a feeling! It doesn’t reflect reality, but it will take some time and experience to learn it on your own. And you will! But be patient with yourself! Take time and be kind. If you would be kind to another in your situation, show that same kindness to yourself.

Having a few good people around you that you know you can trust is a great thing and that comfort can be hard to find should you lose them. Invest in them and take the time to do new things. Books are a great way to inspire, so why not try to read some motivational books? If you think you could be depressed then please tell someone close to you that you trust. I would not advise using the internet as it can create a safety net feeling of having people there without real connection.', \"I can relate to how you are feeling despite being twice your age. I have endured an extremely lonely few years. No one really prepares you in your mid twenties for what will follow, friends going off and getting married, having families and doing their own thing, moving away. I found myself in a situation where a particularly toxic so called friend decided to completely pick apart my character over a perceived sleight, bringing in to it other friends. At a time when I was suffering from severe anxiety, loneliness and depression. All things she made me feel weak for enduring; despite me doing it alone as her and the others all lived far away and were consumed with their own lives, kids, husbands, etc. Their visits to see each other and trips spent together without inviting me have been hard to witness lately, since it all happened with the toxic ex friend they rarely bother to see how I am. I could be dead and they wouldn't know unless social media told them. I have been considering unfriending them all. These are the sort of people that it'd hard to salvage things with, due to resentment and feeling let down, isolated. Since they all went in different directions keeping in touch with each other but ignoring me, I have been very lonely, without a decent family for support, they meant a lot to me.

Of you go home to an empty house, want to do things but instead don't bother as going alone is too worrying and your confidence can crack. If your friends treat you badly then by all means do thing about removing them from your life, if you are in a rut of boredom jump out of it. Go on a camping trip, for a day out, or even just somewhere new, build new memories and make the most of having them.

(They would probably freak out to find out that I am not only gay but also in a long term relationship, over 13 years, with a black man. The love of my life.)

It was very hard and lonely every time that the boys would get older and move on with their lives. I felt as if everyone was outgrowing me. It was very lonely for me. It eventually got to the point where I was an adult and was still trying to “experiment” with boys in middle school. This ended up sending me to prison for 18 years.

Truth be told I’m not sure there is a single thing I can say to add to it all. I’ve read most of the answers and everything I could say has been said in one fashion or another. So why am I bothering to add to the chatter? I guess I just want to help. I just can’t ignore a young voice crying out in the dark. So what can I possibly say to help? Your not alone, I’ve been there and there are others in the same place you are right now. That doesn’t make your pain any less painful though. When I was young and in that black pit of despair similar to yours I couldn’t see a way out. Unlike you I didn’t even have one friend. I was the new girl. The one people made fun of. Then another new girl came and I thought she might be my friend or at least divert attention from me but it only got worse. When she joined in on the tormenting I called her the worst name I could think of and then I felt like slime. I felt bad because I was now no better then all the rotten kids who liked to hurt the small kids, the new kids, the week or different kids. That’s when something started to change. Not with the kids but with me. I started to decide just what kind of person I wanted to be. Now yours isn’t a case of bulling but having been bullied I can tell you I felt extremely alone. That incident was a gentle epiphany in my life, one of three that began my journey into adulthood. That was the day I decided that I needed to work on “ME” and forget “THEM”. I’m sure someone in all these answers mentioned this to you already but its important enough to repeat. Work on yourself. Make your life one you like, make yourself someone you like. Stop sitting at home in the dark. Go out there and learn about life and what you want out of it. There is more to it then the four walls of your house. Now I know someone said that, lol. Those two other little epiphanies I had? Well I’m not sure they are the same for everyone. I think you need to go out there and find yours. It’s kind of like that movie “City Slickers”, Curly holds up his finger and says you have to find that one thing. Well you can’t find your one thing sitting at home. My next epiphany I found while doing a class photo assignment for an art class with a home made box camera. I learned even in my dark child's life I could find beauty. You can find it anywhere even in a trash heap, you just need to look for it. Again you need to go look for it. My third epiphany was around the age of 19, when I saw how sudden a life could change or end. No matter how bad you feel, just hang on, before you know it, life will change in a flash. Be strong and soldier on. Which led me to something I learned latter in life, not an epiphany but important none the less. Like someone else said a smile can go a long way. In this case I’m talking about someone else’s smile though. When ever I felt really low and alone, I’d go do something for someone and look for a smile and give them mine. It helps. Good luck finding your epiphanies, maybe you’ll take one of mine or one from someone else who answered you. They’re right you know. You have to be willing to change. You have to be willing to conceive of a life that’s different from the one you have now. The longer you live the more you learn. Good luck, your not alone, never alone.\", 'There are really two questions here, and although the two conditions often go together, they aren’t the same thing.

For me I became happier when I made internet friends with people my age or slightly younger. It’s obviously not good to be on an electronic device all the time, but especially when it’s vacation and you have no one to talk to, and your family is somewhere else so you can’t really talk to them, then build a relationship with someone around your age online! For me I made a friend who’s 11 years old and lives in California through instagram; she’s always so positive and I definitely do not regret this decision. Be careful for strange, suspicious people obviously but try to find peeps around your age who might be looking for friends too!', 'Being Lonely is a state of mind you can feel lonely when you are alone and even when you are among people . There is two thing there is disconnect with yourself and with outer world or even both you should analyse what is your case . Most of us are rarely in touch with ourself only few Developed men are really in sync with themselves they feel completely at peace even when Alone that requires effort to achieve ie meditation spirituality etc But you can easily remain connected with outer world But for this you need to create Deep Bonds with outside this include Friends relatives or Nature around you . Deep bonds take time to nurture with understanding . You must develop both your side inner connect and outer connect .', \"Think back to what made you happy then . But it must be understood you're in an age group where the competition for a significant romantic partner, career and wealth is only going to intensify and at times get emotionally tough . Hang in there , figure out a starting point that won't destroy your positive self image if you stumble . Stay busy and engaged. Try to keep moving forward in work , school , friends and don't put all your hope on one thing. We are a product of evolution , so don't let your expectations get too high . We humans didn't descend from saints , we evolved from beasts . Also last but not the least , improve your character as much as possible . Too many folks with dubious motives trashing the planet for self gain .\", 'I’m sorry, but I feel the need to quote Dr. Seuss from Oh, The Places You’ll Go! “All Alone! Whether you like it or not, Alone is something you’ll be quite a lot.” It’s so true and worse than ever because our phones and social media have hijacked our lives.', 'I think the answer for you might depend on what is causing your loneliness. Is it lack of friends or a significant other? It might be hard, but you may have to put yourself out there to find more people to spend time with.', 'If your lonely even when surrounded by a bunch of friends you might need to do some serious introspection to find where that’s coming from. It may be finding people you have more in common with, or just accepting that loneliness can be a part of life. In that case I would recommend keeping busy.', 'There are two ways.', 'You can try to re - arange the external circumstances of your life or you can go within and create change internally.', 'Internal change may seems like a whimsical mystery , but the whole world is contantly trying to change all the external factors, hoping this will bring about the coveted and hoped for happiness, hoping that in some way they can create some perfect circumstance that will create happiness.', 'The journey is the destination', 'my friend, so start enjoying it and you will start living your way to the anser you seek.', 'Thank you for this question.

You need the love and attention of your peers. And that's okay. There's no reason to feel like an attention whore. Lots of people experience what you're going through right now. But, you need to love yourself first. Loving yourself can lead to Independence. Where you can just be happy by just being with yourself. But if that doesn't work, try to expand your social circle. Try to go out and meet new friends. Don't be afraid. Everybody goes through this. And that's fine. It's perfectly normal. Lastly, you might not be religious, but remember, this is just a suggestion. Read the Bible. Get to know God. And you may find just what kind of happiness you're looking for. I should know. That's where I found mine.\"]\n"

Some prefer solitude due to lack of patience w/ average IQ people.

One has nothing to do with the other.', 'What makes people think that this idea is true is that young people can be extraordinarily cruel to anyone they think is different — especially to intelligent kids. However, it doesn’t work that way later in life. As we get older we get respect rather than ridicule.', 'Thanks Paul for A2A.', 'Extremely intelligent people, who do not favor living lonely, would be smart enough to avoid loneliness at all costs. They may, at times, need total isolation for certain period of time, yet they would come out of that as soon as their work is over.

Depression, anxiety, and high IQ go hand in hand. They aren't necessarily lonely people in general, however they tend to spend more time alone in study or thought and reclude by happenstance. As Jordan Peterson.said, “The pursuit of happiness is a pointless goal.” When we are working we are struggling. Those who strive the furthest, struggle the most and therefore become tge most successful. So those who suffer the most, succeed the most in spite their happiness.\", \"Being lonely and choosing to spend one's time alone are two completely different scenarios. Being lonely is the desire of other people's company but absent of it. Choosing to spend one's time alone is the desire not to have others present but may have others company at any given time. The train highly intelligent people choose their alone time is because the majority of intelligent people have introverted personalities and this is when they recharge their batteries, go over the days events and prepare for future social interaction.\", \"Probably. In many cases.. I don't know about all cases. I don't know the percentages. I don't know the population of lonely smart people to not lonely ones. If I was extra smart my answer would be a resounding yes! Cause that's life for me who may be smart but who is without doubt lonesome. I think high intelligence can be damaged by the world to where it turns into shyness and very intense social awkwardness.\", \"Mentally and intellectually you will be lonely yes - unless you're surrounded by family, a spouse or partner with extreme intelligence.\", \"Socially, love/empathy/feelings etc you will not be lonely just as I'm.not lonely when I'm around my cat - allthough she might be intellectually lonely since cats IQ are multiplied with 9 compared to humans depending on how many lives they have left.\", 'Yes,', 'It’s one of the known traits in the highly intelligent group of people. There is very few people to be able to talk with at the same level we can on subjects we would like to.', 'Even those who fit your question and are married are often still bored and lonely.', 'Generally not. A lot of them are introverts and really enjoy their alone time. To them it is something good because they relish the time they have being able to think freely without other people interference. There are also extrovert intellectuals. For those being around lots of people is more enjoyable than being alone.', 'In general, the answer is yes highly intelligent people are more prone to be lonely because in most cases they have few friends who also share their range of or depth of understanding of topics. There are many other reasons why highly intelligent people tend to be lonelier and I encourage others to further refine this question.', 'Not as much lonely as a loner. Not as much lost as engrossed. Also, not as much needing the structures of relationship game as needing to fill an endless void of discovery. The very intelligent person is full of things that actually keep him separated but not so much lonely. Hope that brief answer helps…', 'Yes. Except for others like them who will talk with them….

      "['How loneliness can mentally disturb a person? - Quora', 'Identifying and diagnosing a mental health issue is never an easy process. Most mental health struggles do not live in isolation, and many of us have negative thought or mood tendencies that, while challenging, do not qualify as a disorder.As a relationship coach, I’ve found that loneliness is one of these tendencies that often come along with a diagnosed mental health disorder. While correlation is not causation, it seems that loneliness could be more of a cause than a symptom in some of our commonly recognized mental health issues.Human closeness is fundamental to our mental well-being; without it, any number of pathologies could plague us. The loneliness that arises from a lack of human closeness could easily bring about any number of presenting problems.', '1.) Depression:', 'Loneliness and depression have always gone hand-in-hand. We’ve all experienced moments when we find ourselves a little down due to a lack of close friendships. If someone had', 'no', 'close relationships in her life, it’s not a stretch to assume she would feel some powerful malaise as a result.Recently, a study conducted over a five year period at the University of Chicago found that the presence of loneliness early in the five year span was an excellent predictor for depression later in the five year span. In fact, loneliness was an even better predictor than the presence of depression itself early in the five year span. What does this indicate? Loneliness may precede depression even more frequently than depression precedes depression.', '2.) Social Anxiety:', 'If one’s loneliness is not caused by physical isolation (such as living in a very sparsely populated town), it’s reasonable to think loneliness may be caused by discomfort getting to know people. This is usually called social anxiety. While there are extreme forms of this problem – not being able to leave the house, for example – the more mild symptoms of social anxiety could be caused by feeling alone. You may feel as if you’re unlikeable or unworthy of good relationships, causing fear and anxiety about the process of forming them. Lonely people are not lonely because they don’t know how to talk to people. Instead, findings suggest they struggle with relationships because they are scared of messing up– they worry about saying the wrong thing in social situations. I see this as suggesting that loneliness and social anxiety may be intertwined, creating a vicious cycle of isolation and fear of isolation.', '3.) Addiction:', 'Released in January 2015, Johann Hari’s revolutionary book', 'Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on', 'made people aware that drug addiction may be much more than just chemical hooks in the brain. He posits that when people lead lives full of closeness with others, they do not become addicted to drugs – even when they are put on powerful painkillers after an accident, for example. But the opposite is also true. Those who feel lonely', 'before', \"ever taking a drug are much more likely to get hooked. , As we references the work of Professor Peter Cohen, who says: “If we can't connect with each other, we will connect with anything we can find - the whirr of a roulette wheel or the prick of a syringe. [Professor Cohen] says we should stop talking about 'addiction' altogether, and instead call it 'bonding.' A heroin addict has bonded with heroin because she couldn't bond as fully with anything else. So the opposite of addiction is not sobriety. It is human connection.”\", '4.) Hoarding:', 'While hoarding is generally categorized as an obsessive-compulsive disorder, there is an element of loss and heartache in filling one’s life up with stuff. When we’re not able to fill up our lives with close friends and family, some people may turn to comforting objects to fill the void. The International Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Foundation speaks directly to this, stating: \"Loneliness is one of the main factors that causes hoarding to occur.”article continues after advertisementWe’ve likely all touched on this tendency to a certain extent – holding on to the trinkets, letters, and keepsakes of a relationship that’s ended, for example. These objects may “fill the emptiness,” but as the emptiness gets bigger, so may the mountain of objects.If you suffer from one of the above conditions, or know someone who does, it may be worth considering if loneliness is playing a part in perpetuating the problem. Addressing your loneliness could be the key to unleashing your healthy mind.', 'Vinay Bargat', 'Solitude is a State of the Mind and loneliness is a feeling. Man is a social being by nature. In other words, interactions with other others is a process of learning and encourages the growth of the mind hence, the personality. Communication with other minds gives the very motivation to live life. Therefore, when solitude is awarded as a punishment then loneliness becomes painful because firstly, it is perceived as a punishment and secondly, as it goes against the basic grain of human emotional requirement or desire.', \"But when solitude is self imposed in a measured and planned manner with a purpose, then it becomes a boon. It provides the opportunity to spend time with oneself. It is important to to create a space for the self as it is an imperative condition for self analysis or introspection. Introspection is the crucial attribute of an evolved personality. It is a means to achieve wisdom and maturity. Some individuals are afraid of spending time with themselves and they often hide behind the excuse of the natural and the dire need to socialise. Why are they afraid of spending time in solitude? Most often it's their habitual behaviour of evading problems or uncomfortable thoughts. It is an escapist attitude. It may also be a sign of the lack of self confidence. In other words, such individuals may lack the basic skills to analyse and find solutions to their problems. It may also be that they not only have a highly developed sense of defence mechanism but in a state of incompetency, they would avoid being with self. Obviously to prevent situations where self realisation of one's faults are likely to happen.\", \"Therefore, loneliness is a feeling and the intensity of which will depend on one's mental make up and would affect an individual accordingly. Solitude will not always create the feeling of loneliness. It would entirely depend on the mind set of individual and ofcourse, on the circumstances in which it presents itself.\", 'For 25 years, I was alone in my bedroom. I wouldn’t go out.

When my father died, I didn’t talk to anybody. It took me 23 years to talk to someone openly about my sexual aggression. As soon as something bad happened I would keep it for myself.

I have suffered from psychosis, mania, and depression multiple times. My mind was sometimes racing, at others times slowed and for some periods of time, I was deeply suicidal. I truly believed that loneliness exacerbated my problems in psychiatry. Human nature is meant to be lived with others. Humans need to share their emotions, their experiences, their stories with people around them. Connections with real human beings make all the difference.', 'Now when I suffer from depression, I ask to see more people. I feel energized when I see the persons I love the most.

The abuse was more or less constant, and it quickly wore me down.', 'Which is a real shame, because I’m not really a shy person at all. I just felt unwelcome in society because of the way I looked.

You don't have to listen. You don't even have to care. Many people don't. Many of those who do listen forget shortly afterwards. That's okay.\\nFor the few that this touches a nerve with.. I'm sorry.\\nFor the one that this is most dedicated to... I still care.\", \"I love someone. I grew up with her, and though we saw one another seldom, and otherwise almost did not speak to one another, when we were together, we were inseparable. We made and make each other happy. We were in all things, together, and nothing else seemed to matter. She made me feel free, even when I had so much else going on in my life. We talked without restraint, and we laughed together, at times, even without saying anything. On vacations, it was always us who were farthest out in the water, who were always ahead of the hiking group, always climbing in the trees and sharing the little things we found. It was always us who were holding hands. I've had a crush on her since about 8 years ago. She was my best friend, and I did not dare to show it.\\nWe began to text one another. We held hands watching the fireworks, and continued to lay there, watching the stars. I swore an oath that night that I would never ever break her heart if she entrusted me with it. I've never regretted that. Soon after, we nearly simultaneously admitted our feelings. We dated, and it was the greatest feeling, even though we were almost always physically apart. We never kissed; knowing the other was there was bliss enough. Once we cuddled. I can still feel her against me sometimes. I love her,\", 'and it is the worst thing in the world.', \"Remember how I said we were inseparable? My parents told me one day to associate with her as little as possible. They said that she obviously liked me (I think I nearly exploded in happiness inside, then) and that they didn't like her. At all. Because she might be like her mother. The way they said it, it was obvious that they thought I didn't like her either--and that they might berserk and hurt her if they found out. Every time I saw her, though, I couldn't keep myself away from her, no matter how hard I tried. I always got yelled at a bit afterwards, but I didn't really care.\\nI told her about this, when we started dating (in secret) so she would know why I could never bring her on a real date. She accepted anyway. We dated for two months. Whenever we saw each other in person, we positively exploded with affection. It was challenging to keep our relationship a secret, but still one of the best things I have ever done. And the main reason we never kissed was because I never did. I felt it best to wait until she wanted to. I have kind of unsightly lips, so I wanted her to decide whether or not to kiss. I figured if she did, she would kiss me. I probably should have mentioned it, but I didn't, so she never knew. In hindsight, I definitely fell short of the ball there.\\nEventually, she left me. It was a peaceful good-terms breakup. I can understand why it happened; I was a terrible boyfriend, honestly. And with my parents, I probably couldn't marry her anyway. She really tried to keep it alive, and I did too, but it just didn't work out. I think she hates me now. At least, she doesn't love me. She stopped talking to me, and blocked me in all the ways we used to talk. I miss her terribly, but I really can't blame her for what she did.\\nI've tried to move on as she did, but I just can't seem to. It's been over half a year, and I still miss her as much as ever. It hurts knowing that I will probably never see her again, and that she definitely won't ever have another relationship with me (seeing how stressful the first one was to keep) much less marry me. I still keep it as much a secret as I can, so my parents don't hurt her. I don't think she realizes that's what they would probably do, and I don't want her to worry. No one I've talked to or known seems even close in comparison. Some people have found out; I've spilled everything, and they've kept it a secret. But soon after they forget, so it's almost as if I never told them. Well, at least they will keep the secret if they forget what it is. Sometimes, I just write long notes to myself and burn them. I even cut myself once (I wasn't actually paying attention) and before I knew it I had scratched myself to bleeding, tracing the back of my hand with a sharp pencil. I still have the scars--her initials. I write poems to her, make her presents, letters, pick her flowers, sing her songs, draw her things, and never send them.

Whenever you are thinking of the ‘I’, you have to, you compulsorily have to simultaneously factor in the world. There is no way you can think of yourself without thinking of the world.

If that is the case, planning events and get-togethers for yourself, where you have the possibility of meeting and befriending new people, would be a sure-fire bet against that possibility of future loneliness. The internet is great for that with its many places to find common interests. I have also found that when I feel that I will have too much time to myself, and may be finding myself in the middle of my own pity party, reaching out to others in need always makes my view of life improve. Pick an organization or charity that you feel passion for, and you will find yourself swept away by how much more you get than you give. There are recent studies which actually prove that giving to others greatly increases our own levels of seratonin and dopamine, which physiologically and emotionally makes us feel better.', 'As for how solitude can be embraced…', 'Each opportunity that we have to be alone, remove ourselves from the influences of others, and truly focus on who we are at our core, and how we can improve that inner person, is a chance to learn and grow. There is a book that I have been reading lately called “Running With Mindfulness” which makes the case that we can find new levels of ourselves while exercising, and it has been proven that the brain actually opens up our senses to a new degree when we walk or run, creating the possibility for greater understanding on an entirely new level that we would not have been able to access without the exercise. What an ideal time to ask ourselves to be in the moment and be grateful for the chance to truly be with that inner self.', 'Secondly, think of your time alone as a blessing. Why? How many times do we come across people who run around so much, and must have people around ALL THE TIME, purposely making sure that they are never alone with their thoughts? How deeply sad and harmful for them. Truly. When the arrows of life that hit us all strike these individuals, they will be like deer in headlights, having no idea which way to go. They will not have spent the time getting to know themselves and how to react in a time of crisis, and therefore will be much more likely to crumble without the support of others.

Who made you feel that way? What was it you avoided when decided to isolate yourself? First, be grateful for having such a powerful mind, doing such a great job protecting you, that’s its purpose. Then embrace this hidden pain because there is a part of you that you need to bring home. Accept that part of you, embrace that version of you, that little child, cuddle him, be kind and protective with him, it’s another aspect of you, it’s the “son” that was wandering away from home.

In fact my time spent with other human beings is very limited.', 'My two dogs and my husband died within a three week period so I had a hell of a lot of adjusting to do all at once. My days lost their purpose and structure entirely so I had to find a way of surviving and transitioning through that without the usual support that most people have.

He forces me to develop a routine, get up and go out and that was a real salvation during the hardest times. Through him I get to have brief but pleasant interactions with other dog lovers.', 'So in answer to your question, you just do it. Embrace your situation, accept it and make the best of it.

Boast for requesting my answer.', 'There is a distinction between loneliness and solitude. Embrace solitude so that you feel less lonely. Feeling loneliness is a strong feeling like a pain that prevents us from being alone for too long. In evolutionary terms being alone was a risk because you could easily be attacked by others. Solitude on the contrary (has a nice description) and means the quality or state of being alone or remote from society. You can embrace being in solitude.', 'You can embrace being alone and use the time for self-discovery and reflection. The moment we are apart from other human beings we feel ourselves better.

But no, it got to the point where I would catch bugs on the playground all alone during recess. It didn’t matter how hard I fought, I was still lonely.', 'So eventually (recently, actually) I made a choice: it doesn’t matter how people think of me. I don’t have to be popular to be loved. Loneliness is a sign of strength, not weakness. And with that, I learned to embrace solitude, rather than rebel against it. I know that as humans, we tend to be drawn to socializing. I guess you could call it our “default” mindset. But by changing our mindset to the opposite, we can artificially enforce a pro-solitude attitude. Once the foundation of our beliefs is changed, our attitudes and behavior will follow.', 'you may want to clarify what is the difference between the two concepts. If you live in solitude you don’t necessarily feel lonely. Loneliness is the feeling of ‘poor me’, nobody understands me and I’d like that someone did [although I am not sure I understand myself]. So long as you entertain this ‘poor me’ feeling you can’t embrace solitude and obviously you can’t loneliness either because that would mean you are in the business of kind of enjoying feeling sorry for yourself, not in that of finding a way out of it. Solitude is not to be embraced but to be experienced when getting rid of the idea of plurality and separation where you are ‘number 1’, concerned about number 1 only. When you see you are one with everything else because, at a very minimum, you cannot be made out of some ‘special’ elements that are not present in the world around you, when you stop the short sightness of seeing only the form you may be able to understand that there cannot be solitude and even less loneliness- ‘what is’ is all you, right here and right now and ‘what is’ cannot not be; it simply is.', 'By indulging yourself in all of the things you like to do but never had the time for.

This is not true in all instances! There are many people and many examples of people who valued solitude and did incredible things with their self-imposed isolation. I myself detest the mostly surface interaction and insincere pleasantries exchanged in day-to-day life. I enjoy time alone and find it useful for reading, studying music, meditation, thinking my own thoughts Etc. I find a lot of Peace in being alone, that in itself is of great value. However moderation is the key. When I feel like having company I reach out to my few friends and get together. I will also attend public functions of one kind or another if I deem they have value. I do not mind exchanging ordinary pleasantries during the course of my day, and try for sincerity and irrepressible good cheer. These small exchanges cannot be undervalued as every positive contribution to the general consciousness is of value! Good luck in achieving balance Alexander.

Then you can embrace alone time as time that is also fulfilling. Then you have control, you feel powerful and complete, all the time, not just with others.', 'Note: depression is a disease, and even knowing how to be fulfilled by your self, cannot stand up against a chemical onslaught like depression.', \"My own experience. Until I realized the fact that I actually like my own company/ stay lonely, I always used to wish someone to be by my side and to talk to and to share moments of the life. If I didn't find them around I used to be upset and sad. Someone very very important to me started ignoring me and I find/ recognize myself. Tried it. Worked. Worked several times. Now I know about it. I don't feel unhappy being alone. So answer to the question is to find inner self. Recognize it. You won't disappoint yourself in that sense.

Social media, movies, and television tell us it is a bad thing. Once you stop listening to the influence this has, you start seeing things differently. You see how solitude does not necessarily mean loneliness. Loneliness does not equal solitude. Change your perspective and what those things mean to you. I look forward to my solitude as it allows me to reconnect and refocus. Loneliness allows me to focus on what is important to me and who I would want to let into my life. Use solitude and loneliness as tools towards working towards your goals.', 'It’s good to enjoy your own company and have some inner peace. It’s also good to seek companionship and fellowship with others. This does not have to be a personal relationship. It can just be enjoying being with others and doing things together. Sooner or later you’ll find someone you have some connection with personally. Many people make the mistake of always looking for that significant other, as if their lives are lacking something.', 'I think a balance of solitude and fellowship is the best for most people. We are a soul, spirit who came here to learn and improve. As a soul we need to go within to reflect and meditate. We need our inner peace and quiet. We also need other people because we learn from them. We’re here to learn after all, and interacting in business or social life allows us to learn faster.', 'Learn to love yourself. That was the answer for me. I started doing the things I wanted. I got used to and actually now embrace being by myself. I like the quiet and clarity you can only feel when you are alone.

      "['How to stand alone and not feel lonely - Quora', 'There is a trick to the loneliness thing. We have to be comfortable in our own skin and enjoy our own company. Until we come to a place of loving acceptance of ourselves we shun our own company.', 'When filled with self-hatred we are likely to not recognize it as such. We prefer to be with others than to be alone with ourselves.', 'Believe me, I went through my personal trials of loneliness, always preferring the company of others to myself. It took me years to recognize what the problem was. I hated myself and certainly wasn’t comfortable being alone with me.', 'The truth is that the path to happiness lies within. It doesn’t involve others. Our personal transformation means to come to a place of love and acceptance of all that we are, our shadow selves and the prettier parts of ourselves.', 'What Is Our Shadow Self?', 'The shadow side of ourselves is the side that farts privately, that burps when we are alone, that gets angry, upset and feels hateful. The parts we hide from others until we come to a place of acceptance of all that we are.', 'We think we are alone. We think that when we don’t see others (physically) that there is no one with us. Yet, the truth is we have guides, angels and an internal living God within. The God within hears every thought, word, deed and is always with us. We are never truly alone, we just think we are.', 'I was never a religious person. I didn’t even know how to pray until I was in my thirties. There is this spark of light within us that loves us unconditionally, always. No matter how badly we treat ourselves, this spark glows with love. The love that we are has always been there, we just didn’t see or feel it because of the noise in our heads.', 'We need to be fully present in the moment. Breathing deeply to recognize all that we are. Once we connect with the angels, guides and the love within we develop a relationship with all those beings and then the magic happens! Try it. Notice what you get back when you tell your angels you love them when you tell yourself that you love you when you tell your guides you want to get to know them, and you love them. We live in an interactive universe. It is not stagnant or dead it is fully alive. Communicate with the stars, the sun the clouds and see how differently you feel about yourself and being “alone.”', 'We are connected to everything around us and within us. The universe is within us and without (outside us). Create a relationship with all that surrounds you, find gratitude for each day and you to see the elements of your life come alive and you to feel so totally different about time alone with you. You are magnificent, why do you need to have anyone with you when all you need is you? When you begin to love yourself so much (the way the universe loves you - totally and completely) you will find others flock to be with you. You become the love that you are and radiate it outward to everyone you meet. You will have friends up the ying yang!', 'Thanks for the A2A Tiff Flair.', \"I'm not sure that I am the best person to answer this question though. I don't believe that I have actually ever felt loneliness. I like being alone and crave time on my own when I have been around people a lot socially or after working all week.\", \"I read somewhere that one needs to feel comfortable in their own skin before they can truly be comfortable being alone with themselves. This has never been true for me. Most of my life I was not comfortable in my own skin but still craved alone time. It wasn't until my diagnosis of Asperger's that I came to accept myself, my strengths and limitations, learning to settle into that and be alright with who I am.\", 'I think standing alone and not feeling lonely is quite a personal and individual thing. Through introspection and input from knowledgeable and trusted influences we learn what our strengths are and how to maximize those. To stand alone I believe we also need to explore our weaknesses to better understand when it is appropriate and in our best interest to ask for assistance. Requesting assistance does not imply that you are not able to stand alone, quite to the contrary, it means you recognize that in order to stand alone, sometimes you may need help. Knowing when to ask for that shows you have insight. This is a strength.', \"Feeling lonely (or not) while standing alone seem not even connected in my way of thinking. If your desire to stand alone excludes other people when you are a naturally social person then you must recognize that about yourself. If being social gives you strength then capitalize on that as it probably helps to build you up. There isn't anything wrong with that. People like helping others learn to stand alone. Accepting that and integrating socialization into your plan to stand alone should reconcile any fear of loneliness.\", 'I think there are two parts to the answer to this question:', 'As Candyce Ossefort-Russell insightfully observes there are two parts to your question. Although I would say taking her two parts and the two questions you put into one, you could say your question has three parts.', 'How do you manage to live alone? And How to live alone but not feel lonely?', 'The first part is rather easy, make sure you plan everything well, then living alone is as easy as pie. Or you could get a help in the house and make him or her do all the housekeeping and keep up your household, while you do everything you like to do.', 'The second parts of your question is in part answered by Candyce Ossefort-Russell I think. So here is what I think you should look at also.', 'Not feel lonely is something completely separate from managing living alone. As there are lots of people who manage to live together and feel lonely and could use the advice of Candyce as well.', 'If you plan your living alone life and actively execute your plan you will find you have little time left to feel lonely, maybe when you are alone in bed just moments before you fall asleep after a busy day managing living alone and just after you woke up you feel lonely.', 'However the most important part about not feeling lonely is accepting yourself and your situation. And accepting yourself and your situation is accepting that the norm society and your parents and your family puts on living with a partner and getting children is bogus. There are lots of people who do not get children and there are lots of people who do not live with someone else. So living alone may be against the norm, but it is not abnormal.', 'If you can accept that you live alone and that it does not reflect on you as a person and a human being, you will find that you stop feeling lonely. If you have a problem with accepting yourself you could try to find council or a therapist that helps you accept that you are not abnormal because you live alone.', 'Btw, an important activity to keep the feeling of loneliness at bay is living a healthy life with enough movement, enough mental challenges and a healthy and balanced eating pattern. As loneliness can be a signal of a beginning depression, due to unhealthy living.', 'What you also could do is explore this feeling of loneliness and try to find out if it has a basis in the reality of your life or that it might be a figment of your imagination. As humans we are rather good at thinking ourselves into a feeling that has nothing to do with where we are in our lives at the moment. So we are very capable of thinking we are lonely just because we are alone. Where it just might be boredom, because we do not know what to do next, but find boredom just a little bit to mundane to accept as a feeling, so we think we are lonely, which is so much more grandiose and exceptional as a feeling and makes us feel special and unique. Yes our brain is a great instrument: It is the ultimate Baron Von Münchhausen: It can think itself into a bog, and it can think itself out of a bog.', 'I have lived alone for most of my adult life and I truly enjoy my alone time. Getting married at 45 changed a lot for me. I have several hobbies and interests so I’ve never found myself with nothing to do. I cannot remember the last time I was bored, if in fact I’ve ever been bored. I have always had a cat or a dog or both at the same time so they get frequent attention playing and cuddling and bring me unlimited laughter or loads of fun with their antics. Every one of my cats knew how to fetch and hubby calls me Dr. Dolittle because animals listen to me, his favorite was the wild turkeys crossing the road and I hollered out the window to let me drive by, the turkeys ran to the side of the road they were closest to and waited for me to go by and then continued on their way. We used to live in the middle of a forest and I always had chipmunks and squirrels, deer, wild turkey, occasionally an elk or a bear roam through the yard. We had a squirrel family that would chirp outside my window and I had to go give them their food every morning. The girl died and the boy appeared really sad and would follow me around even getting into my car on hot days when I’d open the sliding doors in case I wanted to go anywhere and didn’t want to get into the 120 degree hot car. Chippy would hop in and get on my seat and lounge. After a couple years he would listen and come running when I called him.', 'I had a lot of friends before I got married and could always have a guest for dinner over if I just didn’t want to eat alone. I was active and involved in several community activities and I traveled around the state for musical performances three weekends of the month—the fourth weekend was all mine. My busy life was enhanced by my alone time because I could focus on myself and not a family or a spouse so I didn’t get run down trying to juggle someone elses calendar along with mine.', 'I truly enjoy my own company, (I live for the days hubby works a double shift or has to go do a setup for his business). That is pretty important for most everyone though because you take better care of yourself if you like yourself. I have a great imagination and can make myself laugh or I don’t get laughed at because I am doing something silly or stupid. I like to write and often get invites from some professionals I know asking if I will write an article or two or if I will proof or fact check their articles. I have a phone but rarely use it. My mom and oldest call on my birthday and my oldest calls me on Mothers Day otherwise my phone sits quietly and behaves.', 'I enjoy spending time with my guests when I have them so it isn’t like I don’t like people. I just found it easier and less stressful to live alone. Nobody messed up something I cleaned, nobody changed the channel on me. Nobody griped about how much time I was spending on the computer. Nobody (this is my #1 like) ever bounced my checking account since I always know my balance to the penny. I’ve never had any arguments about the temperature I kept the house or had to buy food I didn’t like. Nobody made my shower dirty and nobody ever kept me awake with their snoring. Now I have a puppy that snores louder than any person I know so that one is cancelled out.', 'The biggest thing is to like yourself, enjoy your own company. It took me a few years to realize that I didn’t need to spend all my time with someone else and started to cherish time alone. I actually prefer to be alone now too but I accept that I do need help due to my disability, and I am able to compromise. I really look forward to the time when hubby works a lot or goes out of town for a couple of days. We just have to carefully plan how I am going to eat on those days and stuff, I am not so much a picky eater so having a sandwich or fruit cups works as a meal for me—I love fruit and raw vegetables. Hubby going away for a few days is not impossible, it just takes a little planning. Also, in an emergency or for urgent needs when hubby is out of town, one of my 150 cousins that live nearby will help if I make a phone call. They’ll jump right in if I ask. They always brings me some of my favorite fast food because they don’t want me to starve on their watch! I love my extended family, goofy as they are!', 'This concerns you, me, and many others.', 'I truly believe no one chooses to be alone.', 'Whenever we are with people and they drain us, we tend to prefer aloneness rather than having to get annoyed, irritated, disturbed, confused or angry. This is regarding dealing with neurotypicals (NTs). If we are surrounded by narcissists, their enablers and flying monkeys, it would be imperative to choose to be alone.', \"Whenever we are with someone and we find ourselves focusing more on what we don't want rather than on what we want, if we are awake we will choose to be alone so that we can focus on what we want. Company should add to the quality of our lives. If company is upsetting, what would be the point?\", 'If the point is to master patience, tolerance, compassion, and other admirable/desirable qualities, by all means, we have to accept and resign ourselves to the incompatibilities. Elevating ourselves to the point where we will not allow ourselves to be upset is a spiritual feat.', 'That is by far, too easy to say and extremely difficult to do. Those who have managed this feat will', 'not', 'end up alone. Somebody wiser than me said, in order to have someone to grow old with, we have to be able to overlook a lot of flaws. Again, this is with regards to NTs, not narcissists.', 'So how can you, me, and others stand alone and not feel lonely?', 'I think we have to get used to the loneliness. In my case, I have dogs for company and many passion projects. People who don’t want the responsibility of caring for pets will have to chime in and let us know how they live out their lives of aloneness without feeling lonely.', 'The World’s Biggest Study on Loneliness', 'You discover a lot about yourself when you live alone. How do I get not lonely? I still do sometimes but rarely.', 'Living alone comes with independence, responsibility and full control of your life. It’s knowing yourself more. Maturity.', 'There is more happiness being alone than living with other people. It is never boring for me personally.', 'When I’m not working:', 'I immersed myself with reading.', 'I work in the kitchen trying new recipes from all over the world and share it with my gracious neighbors.', 'I spend the nights practicing techniques (danse orientale) as a hobby.', 'I take walks or cycle to the supermarket. It’s a beautiful scenery.. in the market I enjoy selecting from the massive selection of cheese and the beautiful colours of fruits and vegetables.', 'I can also explore the castle nearby, it’s a 10 minute walk from the house. Not much tourists come here and so I can spend the afternoon reading a book under the shade near an old well of the palace ground. Absolute tranquility!', 'Weekends spend in museums, meeting up with friends/family/partner or sitting at a coffee shop.', 'To stand alone and not feel lonely you should try to understand what your true purpose is and if you have tried to achieve that. Well if you think that this too extreme to start with, I would suggest you take a notepad and jot down all the activities that you have to do for the day. Once you jot down, start working on getting them done. As long as you have your focus preoccupied on some or the other task, you will never feel lonely. What you can do other than this to keep your mind at ease is to meditate and relax. By meditating you will be able to put your mind at ease and you will be able to know yourself better. Do this and keep at it consistently and you will see a lot of changes externally and internally', 'It is possible to live alone without feeling lonely.', 'It needs changes to one’s thinking.', 'Think of ways to engage yourself in activities that keep you busy and satisfying.', 'Think of your aptitudes and interests that give you joy and fulfillment. A lot of feeling fulfillment is possible in serving the society selflessly, be in the company of right people and being helpful to others. When my wife passed away I felt sudden vacuum in my life and felt very lonely. It was the transition I could overcome through self-coaching and engaged myself in meaningful activities that helped me overcome the feeling of loneliness. I took up chairman position in our spiritual group and served a two year term that helped me a lot. I enjoy researching and writing journal articles which activity took a lot of my time.', 'So, think innovatively. It is all within yourself; in your way of thinking.', 'There are things I love to do alone. I actually live in a room I rent from a family so I have a nice balance of both. I did for some time have my 4 bedroom house and my kids were only with me part of the week and with their dad part. I’d miss them a lot and have to find ways to deal with that. I’d actually spend more time in my room than in the rest of the house as it was warmer there. I liked taking baths by candlelight and listening to r n b old school. I sipped wine, or various teas. Back then I also smoked Ganga but I don’t anymore. I don’t know if that’s 4 u but if U don’t have an issue, they are calling it the new “Cali sober.”', 'I also am a musician and writer so I’ve always enjoyed time to myself to write and sing and play my keyboards, to write and journal. I like tv and binge watching Netflix. I keep in touch with lifelong friends and sometimes meet them for coffee. I see my siblings and mom about 1x a month. Another suggestion-which is something my sister started doing, is to look online as to things going on in y9ur community.there are often festivals, lectures at local libraries, nature walks, food and wine tastings, and free jazz concerts. Even if you go solo, these events can be lots of fun and you may even meet people.', 'Volunteering is another way to do something that means something t9 you where y9u also may connect with others who also are caring individuals. It can feel awfully good to see someone smile, or to snuggle with cats or dogs who simply want some attention.', 'I hope these suggestions are of help to you.', 'Standing alone and not feeling alone is to trust and know yourself to be in control of your emotions and ethical standards and not to hold sway to people trying to doubt yourself and your own morality.Been alone and at your lowest ebb will test you as a human being but you will develop spiritually and become stronger and more at peace with yourself more of an inner sense of satisfaction that will make been alone a sense of achievement and you will love others and yourself as each day unfolds.', '‘Stand alone’ - that’s an interesting phrase. It has a purposeful and determined ring to it. I’m assuming that you wish to stand in your own space, be a more integrated person. It sounds like someone who wishes to achieve completeness in themselves. This is a noble and good thing to aspire to. I’m also assuming that the emotion that may be preventing you from achieving your goal is your ‘fear’ of loneliness. Perhaps somewhere in your past, being yourself was stifled by someone? In my own story, I was ‘dragooned’ into the task of making my mother happy (my father was an alcoholic). In the process, I lost my true identity. As a loving boy, I honoured my mother’s needs but neglected my own. I didn’t seem to have a choice in this dysfunctional interplay. The alternative would have been ostracisation, exile and - loneliness. Now, in later life, I see how I was ‘sidetracked’ into this Narcissistic relationship. And so breaking away from it incurs guilt and loneliness (all the things I would have felt had I not acceded to her needs when I was a boy). So, in order to achieve MY goals - recovering my true self and nature, to stand alone - I have these horrible feelings of loneliness. But they are transient! They are fleeting! They will soon disappear! As I grow and recover my identity, I feel stronger and more integrated. Your story will probably be different but the thing to remember when striving for your goals is that you will meet your demons along the way. Loneliness was one of those demons. But you look it in the eye and pass by - on your way to wholeness!!', \"Feeling is an inside job, doesn't matter you stand alone, or with someone, people are lonelier in crowds.\", 'What made you feel lonely? Looking inside:are you longing for love? Missed another half? Or you are longing for understanding? Sometimes, lonely is from no one care for us, family, relationships or simply just no body care for us.

If you start to see that you are better off then some and pray for everyone including yourself it will help. You can get so busy that life will seem ok. People come and go and relationships develop over time. Co-workers provide a social structure which can develop into friendships at times. It takes awhile to bond and sometimes we are better off alone for periods of time. Be grateful you don’t live with a psychopath or abuser, or even difficult people.', 'It’s possible to live alone and not be lonely though loneliness is the new cancer.', 'Having friends is important, participating in group activities or hobbies can be helpful and possibly the simplest solution is to have a pet. This has been shown to have a very significant positive benefit to one’s well being.', 'Truthfully there is a million and one options available to you. Join a book club, take up painting, volunteer for charity work, another very beneficial activity for all parties and so on.', 'Hope this helps. Good luck!', 'Life isn’t magically going to get better once you find someone, lets just get that straight. This is an illusion - a made up reality we’ve built up in our minds, without taking into account all the drama and stress that comes with relationships. It’s not all peaches and cream, especially if the person you’re with isn’t good for you… and you can’t tell because you’re blinded by love. We chase this life thinking we’ll be happy, and we’ve forgotten how to be happy by ourselves and enjoy life alone.', 'Desperation is not attractive, so don’t dwell on these things.', 'Instead of trying to stop your biological need to procreate, just realize it’s perfectly normal to feel lonely sometimes. However, if you just got out of a relationship that sucked you wouldn’t care to be in another relationship for awhile, and you would begin to focus on being happy and enjoying life as a single guy. Point being, it’s a matter of perspective.', 'You don’t have to feel lonely while living alone. There are so many things to do. You can keep yourself occupied with things to do. Take college courses online. You can go to the library and read books also bring some home. Doing things with your time can keep you from feeling certain emotions.', 'Also go to see some movies, rent movies too. Make sure you go to sleep early and eat right so you won’t have any chemical imbalances. You may be feeling some kind of depression too. Go see a therapist. This helps a lot. Nothing to be ashamed of.', 'As the nature of human being is peace and happiness. If you want to stand alone and not feel lonely, I think you have to know the causes that makes you feel that way.

I am an introvert with depression and anxiety, so living alone (after my one 19-year, ultimately failed marriage) works quite well for me.

I’ve tried meet ups and going to events. - Quora\", 'I see a lot of people on Quora and in general saying “you are not alone, there are so many people going through this, stay strong, etc”. I understand their intent, and so I don’t mean to put down that point of view.', 'BUT, that does NOT help everyone unfortunately. How do I know that? Because I have been through this myself in the past, and hearing such statements did not help me. But, something else did. I changed my perception of my situation.', 'How you see yourself, and what story you tell yourself determines the outcomes in your life.', 'When you say you are lonely, what exactly are you telling yourself? You are saying that “I missing a connection with other humans, that I THINK others have”. So, you see, you are comparing yourself to other people, based on your assumptions of how they feel.', 'When you say you no longer want to live because you feel lonely, what are you sub-consciously telling yourself and the outside world? “I NEED and DEPEND on other people to feel happy and worthy. That is, I am not worthy of living, if someone else does not accept me or spend time with me.”', 'When you think and feel this way, other people are naturally put off and repulsed by this. Hence, you will feel more lonely and more depressed. So, STOP yearning for companionship/friendship. Let go of it, and it will find you. Let’s say you see 2 street dogs. One is messy, sad and looks depressed. The other one looks cheerful, playful and happy. Which one are you more likely to feed?', 'There is ONLY one real long-term solution to stop feeling lonely, and coming out of it for good. Loneliness is just a label you have given yourself. Stop believing this label. REFUSE this label, and learn to enjoy your own company. DO THINGS that make you happy. WHATEVER they may be. Fly kites, zap mosquitoes, cleaning your bathroom, your job, whatever. Do it. Keep doing it. Realise how lucky you are that you are able to do that things that you enjoy. When you are able to do that consistently, you NO longer will feel lonely, and that’s when magic will happen. That’s when people will genuinely want to be with you. This my seem like counter-intuitive, but it also happens to be true.', 'And, Stop this “I want to die” business….Realize and Accept that you are worthy of living, with or without friends for now. What does that mean? You don’t make your heart beat when you go to sleep. Something is giving you life and keeping you alive. Then, your life MUST be of some value. Find out what that is.', 'Why should I bother typing all this to you? Your life must be worth something, right? Find out what that is. You could have killed yourself before. You did not, because deep down you know that your life is worth living. Go inside and look for answers, they will find you at the right time.', 'My friend, Even if you die, you are going to die alone.', 'So dying is not the solution.

Watch A Movie', 'Watch a movie alone or call some friends to go with you—it doesn’t matter. What’s important is you immerse yourself in an interesting story that’ll erase your gloomy thoughts.

Volunteer', 'Focusing on the needs of others steers your mind away from sad thoughts. It’s impossible to feel lonely when you’re feeding the homeless, reading to kids at an orphanage, or dancing with grandmas at a salsa class.

The playfulness of pets, plus the troubles (and fun) you’ll experience while training them will make you forget about your troubles. Even a goldfish or pretty parrot can do wonders for your mood.', '8. Identify The Cause Of Your Loneliness', '“What to do when you feel lonely?”', 'I can’t imagine how many people have Googled that phrase when they felt the pangs of loneliness. Unfortunately, it’s not the best question to ask. Would you ask a doctor for a prescription before they check your symptoms?', 'Instead of trying things randomly, hoping one solution will do the trick—losing hope and feeling worse when it doesn’t—it’s better to identify the cause of your loneliness first. If you were previously happy in your own company, what could’ve caused you to feel lonely this time?', 'Do your friends make you feel lonely? Is it your work or surroundings, perhaps? The cause of your loneliness will clue you in on the appropriate solution.', '9. Read Fiction', 'Please don’t pick a Dummies book on how to stop feeling lonely.

In the shower, right? Taking a nice, long, and relaxing bath is a great way to be bask in your alone time, instead of drowning in self-pity. Ladies, prepare a glass of red, chocolates and magazines.

Then order coffee and sit on the bar, or that big table on the center where you can talk to people. Compliment someone on their tie, shoes or bag. Start a conversation.

Get A Camera', 'Get a camera, then go out and start taking beautiful pictures of things around you. A sunset, a barking dog, or a laughing baby—filling your life with beautiful things can take your mind off of loneliness.', '20. Attend Classes For A Fun New Exercise Like Air Yoga, Pole Dancing, Or Trampoline Jumping', 'The exact exercise doesn’t matter. The point is to get yourself moving, while trying something new in the supportive environment of a group class.', '21. Start A 5-Minute Gratitude Journal', 'It’s hard to feel down when you know that you have a lot to be thankful for. When you don’t know what to be thankful for, just write what you feel.

The great thing is that because others there will be in the same position as you, then you may make friends in the group!', 'The problem with meet-ups is that you have no easy way of starting to chat with people. There are better situations for making friends. If you ask someone who has a lot of friends how they got them, you’ll get a reply like:', '“Oh, John lives just around the corner - we used to chat about his garden. Sue goes to the same cafe as I go to - I would hold her dog while she went inside. Jenny and I went to French classes. Mark and I belong to the same political group. Anitka goes to the same church as I do.”', 'And so on.', 'In other words,', 'we find it easier to make friends when we have something in common.', 'It’s quite easy in a book-reading group to chat to someone who also likes South American writers; it’s also easy to chat to someone who helps out at the local charity about how you can decorate the place.', 'So fill your life', '- go to evening classes, join a political group, campaign against that new massive store that will be built nearby, join a painting class, help in your local museum... Please, fill your life!', 'Just doing those things without insisting that you make friends straight away will dramatically reduce your loneliness. But if you happen to make friends, then great.

I will skip the celebration of being and cut to the chase. Get a dog. A dog will show you lots of love and affection- will have missed you while you are at work, while requiring you do a number of things for it. The void you feel is the basic need to connect to another life, the life does not have to be human and dogs behavior pretty much zeros in on the traits and qualities needed to give you purpose again. You will find that the simple need to consider his/her vet visits, food supply, water supply, bric a brack to keep them occupied while you are gone and the daily ritual of a walk will actually act like a bandage upon your soul. Depending on your participation it may even become a splint. The love a dog gives is absolute, you will find companionship and relief from your estrangement. Its also worth mentioning that dogs are great ice breakers with people and that you may end up over time finding friends due to your dog. If you grow to love the dog you will discover that not wanting to leave it alone in the world may at times be the rock you cling to to keep you from suicide.', 'General advice of anyone will be to make friends, go to parties', 'but', 'that’s not what you have to do. “Trying” to make friends doesn’t works mostly.

And let me start by saying how glad it makes me feel to see the 100+ answers to this question and I think may be at least 10% of these people will be able to relate with the extent of my relationship with loneliness. I am not a special or an unusual example in any sense and could easily attest to most of the things mentioned in some of the other answers here which I just went through, except that may be I find a sharper version of some in my life and have a couple of things to add.', 'Introduction.', \"I am almost 28 year old, a straight male and from a demographic which would be considered the majority in many spheres. I do not suffer from any social anxiety, or a documented disorder which would prevent me from normal interactions in any situation (and trust me I have done my research). I don't exactly know what's wrong with me and only reason I could offer is that I am too different from most people and too indifferent to care about it, especially now and at this age.\", \"Just to give you a taste of what my life is like, I have been living alone for many years now. The only people I know and communicate with in any capacity are work friends, or rather colleagues. Outside this circle, I have conversed with my parents, siblings and may be 3 other “friends” in the whole of last year. I don't recall the last time my phone rang with a non marketing call. But all these things are pretty normal in any lonely person's life and there is nothing new about mine.\", 'What I will instead describe here are mostly the psychological effects and tribulations that it entails, and again, apologies in advance if these have been shared before. I have been in this state for more than 4 years now with few short laps of human contact here and there (more on that as I go on), which in retrospect might only have exacerbated the pain of an otherwise consistent lifestyle. And as any discussion on loneliness is incomplete without the mention of relationship, I would say I have none, and never had one with the exception of a couple short lived flings constituting those aforementioned companionship experiences.', 'Time.', 'The biggest and most crucial factor in the extremities of loneliness is the factor of time. And granted, I may not have yet experienced extraordinary lengths of time that some of the other responders here have, I still have gone through many phases and changed a whole lot during this period. The thing about humans is that we are pathologically social beings, to the point of almost non-existence in complete isolation (true for most of us). Our personalities, and our memories shape in the way they do because they contain the element of company in them. Having spent most of my 20s in moderate to extreme isolation, I can feel the difference between my childhood memories and those from last few years. The latter are only revived in brain with a distinct vacuousness, as if they are soulless and the only parts that shine among them are the ones which contain the presence of someone else. As a matter of fact, most of my alone memories and experiences I created can be washed out by one tinge of a powerful remembrance that includes another human being. The way it affects me is subtle. Years go by and I don\\'t \"fully\" realize I have really lived a life. So strictly speaking, it becomes less of an existence than that of a normal human being.', 'Emotions.', 'Emotions are hardest and most unpredictable part to achieve control over. I have gone through very miserable cycles of utter despair, heartbreak, depression and insomnia before arriving at a point where tears have become hard to bring about. And given my lonely existence, other psychological afflictions like emotional vulnerabilities, predilection to romanticism, lower confidence, premature attachment, many insecurities etc. are difficult to avoid and have been an integral part of my personality. But this question is not about that and I will spare all the details. The key takeaway is that lonely people are more susceptible to emotional breakdowns and experience higher degree of pains from break-ups and other strains in relationships or attachments in general. I am no exception to that.', 'Phases.', 'Here\\'s where it gets interesting. When I started this journey I was a novice, and utterly clueless of what lay ahead in future. I was thrown into a situation where inevitably I was forced to live a life that I have never wanted or anticipated. I started with zero experience in this and can now dare to call myself an expert on loneliness, but that doesn\\'t mean I still don\\'t learn a lot about it or about myself everyday. The next few lines are very specific to me and don\\'t generalize well to loners unlike most of my other description. The first phase was of getting used to the new circumstances, and it was easiest of all since it still consisted of my leftover remains from years before and a struggle and hope to keep them alive. The next phase was filled with heavy disappointment caused by failures from former stage and a long period of bereavement for an unrequited love, extreme episodes of depression and the onset of desperation for companionship. The third and very long phase was the peak of this desperation and a sort of final attempt to achieve the normalcy through multiple efforts for securing love or engaging in other social activities which resulted into partial but temporary success. The fourth phase (in so far) has been the acceptance of fate, avoidance of triggers, masking of feelings, and an overall emotional frigidity. And ironically, the closest I have come to feeling \"happy\" in all these years has been in the current phase.', 'Changes.', 'Chronic loneliness changes you, at primitive biological level. And I say this not just because I sense it or have experienced it but also because research in neuroscience has shown the occurrences of physical changes in our brains long after we step into adulthood, and possibly lifelong. I still adapt myself everyday to new waves of loneliness and sometimes hard earned lessons need repeated reminding to be fully learnt and put in practice. I have heard that being lonely and single only gets harder as one gets older. So far I have only heard this, but there is little I can do other than mentally preparing myself for the future.', 'Summary.', \"Life means very different thing to me than to most people. It's less of a pursuit and more of a curiosity and challenge for me. What started out as a mild and later excruciating pain that I wanted to get immediately rid of, has turned into something deep, something meaningful. Loneliness is my most reliable companion now, as it never leaves me alone. I am not depressed anymore, lost may be, but not wallowing in constant agony. And it's only the beginning but I like to think that the worst part of this experience, getting accustomed to it, is over. I am very likely wrong in believing that this was the worst part but making my peace with living this way was crossing of a big hurdle for me. I know that having been made by the genes which are wired for attachment and intimate alliance with someone from the same species, though I can never claim victory over loneliness, it can be soothed and adapted towards an ultimate acceptance. Besides, I am still living in a functioning breathing society of humans, not in a forest, and hopefully the silent passive company of others will be enough consolation for me to survive!\", 'Thank you for your attention.', \"I am 29 years old female, working and living alone.

But that eagerness for a closeness remained. That feeling of loneliness, even when being surrounded by people. I don't know why things turned out that way as they are. I am talkative, people are all the time giving me compliments about my physical looks (please, don't understand this as bragging, I'm only trying to describe the situation), but for some reason life hasn't given me the chance to meet a man, with whom I could start a loving, happy family. I have a lot of friends, meet a lot of new people, but I guess there is just something about my personality that doesn't allow to get on a deeper level. Because you know, even if you do always have a person to call if you want to have a coffee, this isn't enough. These are platonic relationships, which are of course nice, but they don't take away the loneliness. It actually breaks a heart a bit, when you meet your friend for a chat and after she rushes back home to her loving husband and two beautiful sons, and you… you go back to your empty, quiet apartment.\", \"I am aware of the fact that my perception of loneliness is greatly influenced by the ignorance and lack of affection in my growing years, that is why I completely understand that for some people the situation I'm in wouldn't represent loneliness.

In high school and in the university, I had to observe as people form, break up and re-form relationships, and I never really actively ventured to participate in all these social drama. A part of me wanted it, the other forbid me. I occasionally felt emotionally weak and sad within and all, but still, I was paradoxically resolute to avoid any relationship.

It isn't something I thought about often until my daughter commented that I don't have any friends… and I had to admit that she was right, at least to a degree. I do have a long term best friend, one who acknowledges that I am his best friend as well, so there is no fear that one day he's going to call me an acquaintance.

I see other guys hanging out with girls, I see those girls taking an interest in the guys, I see them interacting very well with those guys and it just makes me feel very bad. When I came here in Mumbai to start my college, my anxiety took a hike and I had a panic attack right in the middle of the college’s admission hall. Every where I looked I saw the same kind of girls who laughed at me. Here in Mumbai, all girls look like they are models or are very rich and very celebrity like. I was taught since birth that this particular kind of lifestyle suits the high society only and my family is far below that, so I am having even more trouble adjusting to the fact that every one here is so much upscale than me, specifically girls (who, after much observation, I know aren’t millionaires. Some are even poorer than me money wise). I have no idea if every girl in my college is a rich brat or they are just overly fancy here.', 'Before I moved to Mumbai, I had less problems connecting with people. I had problems nonetheless. I get overly self conscious about my appearance and physique, which is not breathtaking. I am 5’8”, 120 kg, beer belly, not so good looking. Some might call me ugly. With that said, I certainly don’t expect super hot girls to befriend me. Super hot girls are very rare even here in Mumbai even though each girls tries to be one. For me, 8 out of 10 girls here seem super hot. The remaining 2 aren’t as pretty but they are beautiful. Some are even cool. There was this girl I used to work with, she was totally cool when I swore loudly. I thought she was really fun but for some reason, the friendship melted away.', 'I have a lot of anger inside me. On my first day in college, I actually interacted with a girl for five seconds. She smiled at me, I was taken aback but I forced a smile. I expected her to talk with me more but that was it. I ran into the same girl again the next day and attempted to start a conversation but no (actually this one wasn’t even super hot). I don’t get angry when girls don’t want to talk to me or be my friend, I get angry when they would rather talk with some other guy than me. What do others have that I don’t? Just because I don’t look like a Greek god, girls decide I am a loser! I have never ever got a Tinder match while most guys, even the bad ones, get at least 2 – 3 matches here in Mumbai. Their bios say', '“like to meet new people and make friends”', 'but for some reason we never match.', 'On some days, I cannot help but loathe these girls. Sometimes, even while watching porn I half wish the guy would stop fucking the bitch and bang her head on the table. I have an extreme itch to just shout “FUCK YOU BITCH!!!” at the girls in my college and shoot them in the head. I realize that it won’t do anybody any good once I cool down a little. It’s just that in that little period of outburst I feel I can’t focus on anything. I am getting a ton of stress and frustration thinking about this issue, which seems to be in my mind all day long. I keep wishing and searching for something cool in my life that would make the girls think', '“Aww shit! Wish we had made friends with him!”', '. It’s not like I haven’t tried approaching girls, but for some reason I don’t get the response I expect. In fact, the response is pretty lame. Why can’t a girl approach me for a change?', 'I fear my academics can get affected by my issues, which is the last thing I want. On my third day I smiled at one girl in the hallway. All I got was a forced, crooked smile and a weird look. I have seen other guys do the same and get the girl to reciprocate. I keep wondering is it because the other guy is good-looking. If so then why do people label me as a pervert when I say I just want girls with a cute face, big boobs and a nice ass in my life? If that is wrong then girls, too, should come and talk to me without any problem and without judging me by looks.', 'My mind is completely exhausted after dealing with this wretched issue all my life. My head aches at the slightest stimulation. I want the will power to accept that I won’t have any female presence in my life, like ever. I want the strength to accept that I am below, below average looking and no girl would come up to me, ever. Every girl I see is hanging out with some other guy and it just makes me feel very bad. Everyday is a new war I am fighting with myself. Every night I cry myself to sleep, promising myself that I won’t think about these things and will focus on studies but it’s the same story everyday. Writing about it does make me feel a little lighter but I have to face the same thing every morning every damn day. I want to get through college as a loner but can’t get all of these thoughts out of my mind when I see the girls. This is why I feel very lonely in this new city and miss my small, not so upscale, quiet, mini-city very much.', 'All I wanted was just a friend, a female friend. It sounds crazy but yeah, I wanted to have a female friend first. All I wanted was to feel wanted by the girls around me, like other guys. I still daydream about a fictional girl who will come up to me and tell me she wants to be my friend before all the other guys. I guess that happens only in movies. I am not even thinking about romance or a girlfriend. That destination is miles away. My frustration is eating me day and night. So what if I am fat and ugly? So what if I am shy and introverted? Does that mean I am not good enough? I honestly don’t know what to do.', '“Just be yourself and have a conversation”', 'doesn’t work. This has gone to the point where I don’t even like looking at girls, in real life or in movies/TV shows/porn/etc. It is giving me a bad headache all day.', \"I don’t know how do I start my story. I m a 24-year-old guy from India. I was lonely and isolated my whole life even since when I was a kid. I had no fun and happiness in life at all. I have never felt it. There is no one who loves me and no one cares about me, not even my own parents. When I m a shy and introvert guy and no one understands me here. When I was in school I had few friends only boys no girls because girls used to ignore me. I was really immature and very dumb. I have never even kissed a girl in my life ever. Girls didn’t like me at all. I got bullied and harassed so many times in school. Same story when I got into an engineering college. I drop out of college after 1 year because I couldn’t able to complete it, I felt like it was not for me. My life is a complete failure. I have made so many wrong choices and now I have lost it completely. Whatever I have done in life I was always miserably failed in it. It was not all my fault, my parents are unsupportive and uneducated, we are a middle class. They never understand and loved me. They have never encouraged me for anything always scolds me for everything. on the other hand, there is society pressure too. I m so trapped and isolated in life that nobody could understand. I have relatives and cousins but they are just full of hate and negativity. I really do not like people here. I don’t even have good neighbors. I m just living in hell. My parents don’t even allow me to do anything in life. I m just stuck in my room for years. I can’t able to do anything life. Due to all of this, I m extremely depressed and isolated my whole life. I feel no connection with the world. I wish I could leave this place forever but It is impossible. I can’t even a good job so I could get out. I don’t even have money and rest my parents. Due to years of mental illness, I have developed so many psychological disorders like bipolar disorder, extreme introversion, social anxiety, extreme depression, autism spectrum disorder, and loneliness and so on and on. It's hard to handle my life. Every day is just hell, thinking about suicide all day long, every moment, I don’t even know when I was the last time I was truly happy in life. I m really afraid of death because I know that this is the only life I have and I don’t want to miss the chance. I have so many dreams like I want to marry a beautiful, loving girlfriend who will love me and I want to travel the world with her. I want to live in the USA and Europe because I like those countries. These are my dreams of life but now it is gone, it is impossible for me to achieve that. But I don’t know whenever I try to give up on life completely there is something which stops me because somehow in my heart I still crave for a better life. I want to live a better and peaceful life. I do believe in God but he is also not listening to my prayers. I have so many cousins who are so much lucky and successful than me because they have good and supporting parents and they live in much better western countries. They moved there when they were just kids with their parents. I don’t know why it happened to me. I never thought that I would be in this phase of life but here I m. I wish somehow I could restart my life again from a new beginning but I can’t. It's over.\", 'I am a female at 21 years of age and have nothing going for me. I would love some advice.', 'Despite being told I am pretty and get stared at by men, I have had zero dates in my life. In high school I never had a date to a dance, and I got to see all my smiling classmates posing with a guy during prom. They all got asked out in the cutest way. I cannot imagine a man even taking hours of his time to ask me out. I only ever liked one guy in my life, and upon telling him I liked him, he brushed me off and ended up taking out a blonde girl with big tits. Why am I surprised?', 'Men in my life see me as disposable. My dad and brother see me as a retard. Everything I say is brushed aside and I am called names. Slut, ugly, stupid, worthless - my dad said I was going to end up a prostitute one day, despite being the most prudish girl. I am a size zero and take care of my health and appearance, but I am highly concerned that by the time I am thirty, my market value would be even lower to men. I am not desirable to men at 21 (which is supposed to be the prime of my life), so why would I be at 30? What do men want?', 'I always struggled with creating meaningful relationships with other girls my age. I am too nice, people walk all over me. I struggle to connect with other young females - my interests are completely different and mostly masculine (soccer, history, rap, cars, k-dramas, politics, etc). Other girls are so superficial to me - only concerned about boy troubles and taking the best selfies. Really petty stuff. They smack talk everyone. I only have two friends I see on the holidays occasionally. At their parties, I feel very left out because the other girls see me as an alien. I am sorry I don’t wear heavy makeup and don’t take ten selfies a day to show my thousand followers on Instagram. My friends would always hang out without me on weekends and breaks, causing me to cry on Saturday nights in high school.', 'I am not a rude person. I am not mean, I have no enemies. I am only kind and caring to every single person I meet. I am walked over by every person my age and that makes me lonely.', 'My biggest flaw is that I forgive every person who does me wrong.

I have a sister (1 out of 7 siblings) that I do hear from, but she lives several hours away in another direction.

I use to get lot of proposals since my college days, most of my friends use to tell me “ guy will be very lucky to get a girl like u” since my college days. Due to family and social reputation i left to parents to choose a guy for me. Nothing worked out, few which i liked did not work out, Guys who approached me for marriage did not work out., Still i do not know y this happened to me. All of friends(Male n Female) started settling down with their loved ones, started having kids and started inviting me for anniversary, birthdays,house warming . I had to literally avoid talking to them. I deactivated facebook, stopped using whatsapp n other social media. Not because of jealous or fear but to avoid questions such as “u r such a nice person but how u r not able to settle down, not getting guy, do some poojas, compromise lot so that u will get someone, don’t delay, u r getting old,don’t u have feelings” blah blah which was killing my confidence to live day by day.

For my bad fate, i found a friend in the guy who proposed and asked me to marry him but in few days he called off the wedding n left me. I survived this damage being alone. It was always like i had everything but i had nothing. I had everyone but i had no-one. I always use to go every where alone, i use to spend most of my time in temples on weekends, i never use to take leaves unless my manager reminds me i have not availed leaves for months. Worst part was when i was sick enough and cannot walk to hospital, even then i use to go alone thinking this is my life and i will have to do everything on my own. Four walls of my room have seen the most of the loneliness and impacts of it.', 'I reached to the stage that mind has accepted and tuned to being alone, not expecting anyone to fill it. Do everything on my own, feel nothing for the void, accept the hard reality that may be this is how my life is designed and move on with the state of being alone. When the life is not similar to people in society, it creates lot of gap in connecting people and life becomes harder. Now, as on today, i am alone with no friends, (no job for quite sometime so no new people around),no social life, no family life yet i am living. My house is full of people and i am alone. Finally i have understood what does loneliness mean.', 'Oh soooo so so so lonesome. I’ve spent the entirety of my 20 year old life without any serious romantic interactions. I have good friends, but I don’t know how to communicate with my family. This situation gives me an overwhelming sensation of unending isolation, even though my friends keep me plenty occupied. The most frustrating part is that I actually really like myself, and I don’t understand why I don’t leave big impressions on people. I’m not a narcissist either, I do my best to be as self aware as I can manage; I don’t necessarily resent anybody for not being head over heals for me, but I can’t help my emotions.', 'I’m an artist, I have good taste in music, I have my personal sense of style, I have good hair, and I actually think I’m pretty attractive. Despite my romantic ammunition, I’ve yet to make any ground. While I’m very interested in getting out and seeing the world once in a while, I have some introverted tendencies. By “some introverted tendencies”, I mean I spend most of my time in my room drawing, gaming, watching YouTube and anime, and practicing guitar here and there. Oh, and I watch way too much pornography… (whoops).', 'Now, I know what you’re thinking; “Why does this guy complain about being single if he doesn’t make changes to the obvious, counterproductive tendencies he has, in order to combat that reality?” Good question. I agree, but pushing out of the protective bubble of the comfort zone is a task that has proven, time and time again, to be easier said than done. I have some pretty powerful anxieties and irrational fears that tend to always get in the way of my progress. I don’t really understand how people meet strangers and fall in love with them, or how to get dates with girls I don’t know. I feel as though I always find myself in disbelief of girls’ attraction to guys. Of course, straight women are as interested in men as straight men are in women, but my brain doesn’t really cooperate with that fact. I always find myself doubting that any girls I encounter could possibly be interested in going on dates or getting a boyfriend. Like, dudes suck. Why would any girl be trying to get with a guy. It’s a weird irrationality, I know, but I’ve yet to find myself in a situation with a metaphorical green light to go ahead and get serious with a girl. Of course, I might, had she not moved for college (so close).', 'Anywho, thanks for reading! For the other lonely people, don’t give up! There’s somebody for all of us, and we’ll find them eventually! Just don’t give up! -D', \"Before I proceed to answer this I don't want anyone to feel bad for me. I accepted my life and if anyone is out there feeling as bad as I am. I just want to let you know you are not alone. Over a period of 18 years nearly, becoming lonely was a process to me. There was a constant hope I had throughout. I had friends when I was young and not to mention they were constant and I was genuinely happy. I realised that I'm happy around people. I was an outgoing, happy, broadminded girl who spoke to everyone despite how they were to me I spoke to guys as well. When puberty hit everyone I know we all senses that there's something more to friendship. That's when things started to change. I was in 6th grade I had a couple of senior friends as well. Both boys and girls. I was slut shamed for the first time. I didn't know what that meant but when I started knowing the meaning if what it meant I was just devastated I never expected the genuine friends who knew me well to call me that ! My classmates, the seniors I was friends with slutshamed me because apparently I spoke to guys and It was considered flirting.\", \"Literally no one spoke to me. A couple parents asked their kids to distance themselves from me. I didn't know why. I didn't have sex or date guys I was just 11 . What does a 11 year old know and do about all this. My problem wasn't even talkable. It was something I suppressed . Slowly I just became all alone. I started really liking it . I engulfed myself and started getting addicted to staying Alone. I was never blessed to have anybody genuine. People bitched about me, stabbed me, hated me , was always rude to me and hurted me speaking the rudest words. Somewhere I realised that I was never lovable. I was also extremely mature. I had no one to talk to when u had problems, never had a shoulder to cry on, never shared my happiness to anyone. I learnt to deal with it all by myself. I somewhere felt satisfied dealing with my problems, anxieties, fears , happiness with myself. I felt no one is ever going to feel the way I feel. No one is going to feel happy for me, sad for me, or scared for me like I'm going to for myself. So I felt it is better off to be all alone.\", \"I was inexplicably kind to everyone around me because I knew how it felt to be bitched about,betrayed and hurt somebody. I learnt no matter what, it's you and just you who's going be present every second of your life. Your soul is going to undergo every moment of this life you've gotten from the grace of God. I prayed god often, read scriptures told god my problem many of the people would think it's useless but I kept in peace with my soul and cleaned all that I had talking to god and talking to myself.\", \"No one cares for me. No one will ever do. I've not met a single friend over the years. Even if I did, they left me. And I don't expect more from anybody. I help them I am kind to them if they betray me, then I would just leave. No body calls me. No one considers my opinion. No one even looks at me. I go out for a coffee on the rainy days all by myself and enjoy it. I admire all those friends at cafe coffee day or starbucks . I don't envy them. I just feel happy looking at them enjoying life when they're supposed to be doing so ! Maybe I'm missing out on it maybe I'm not.\", \"But all I want to say is remember to love yourself and be proud of your existence till today :) it's a blessing. Be thankful to god that you have a family that you have the capacity to do your everyday activities. You have food to eat, you have water to drink. Read books if you are lonely they can be your best friend :) but most importantly, learn to nurture yourself. Although you are hustling being all alone don't blame yourself for it. It's okay to wait for the best for the genuine people. Mark my words. No one can love you as much as you do or go through the things like you are experiencing. Love yourself & be kind to everyone.\", \"I hope this is not depressing.I just told you what I feel going through this. It's just something I'm going through. And I'm thankful to be lonely to learn somuch by myself and that I'm capable of having myself to handle all that by myself.\", \"May life bring you genuine people and kind hearted souls to face it because that's the greatest blessing one can have.\", \"I am 22 year old computer science student which now have pivoted to Finance.

In these nine years I hardly made new friends and hardly visited new places. I have never travelled beyond 200 kms from my house. And even in my city I have been to very few areas.

My dad used to beat the shit out of me to get better marks in maths. But I had no interest in this subject. My parents never allowed me to play with others in childhood. We were living in a small rented house and there was no water supply inside the house. The town municipal water taps were the only source of water. My parents instead of letting me play forced me to get the water came through those taps. My mother would beat me badly if I disagree to fill the water. My schoolmates never made friendship with me as I was a honest student in the class and it made them feel Im abnormal. I had crush on a girl in between(First crush). Days passed I completed my 9th standard and my family moved to another area in the same town. As I was in 10th standard I completly involved in studies and got passed with distinction. My family members are not so educated they had no Idea about higher education. My father without knowing anything about available couses got me into PCMB(physics,chemistry,maths,biology) in a prestigious college. I had already made a wrong turn here listening to my dad without thinking much. I was from a rural background and struggled a lot to cope up with urban students over there.Again nobody wanted to be my friends. I had a crush on a girl from commerce department(second crush).

I had to get up at 5 in the morning, get ready and reach the bus stop, catch 3 buses and got scolded in class daily for reaching late.Days passed and I deeply know I won’t survive Engineering. I couldn’t understand head and tail of the subjects. First sem results came,I failed in 4 subjects.Second sem result - again 3 subjects failed. I was depressed to the core and was living like zombie. One day my school mates created a whatsapp group which had my first crush contact too. I got her number from the group and started texting,talking day and night. I was slowly healing from depression and forgot my situation,she had a breakup and was looking for someone’s help to get over it. I confessed her I had crush on her and I was about to propose her,she had given me her fb password I didn’t know she was again going behind her ex and was using me like toy untill i logged into her fb and saw her texts with him. I called her and had a fight over phone and got brokeup with her. Inthe mean time One of my childhood friend died. My smartphone got stolen. I met with an accident got my right leg fractured. All the bad things started striking me at once. I was feeling suicidal. I had no friends to share my feelings,no one to put a hand on my shoulder on say everything is goin to be fine. For whole one year I sat home going through mental pain daily. I joined the college again,went there for an year and got a year back again. I was mentally dead and had no idea what to do next! I had already lost 3 years of my life that too teenage years. Society started treating me like failure. I stopped going out of home,attending functions, locked myself in the room. One day my dad scolded me and got me admission into a local degree college for Bcom course. I had my school juniors as my seniors here. I was feeling ashamed daily to go to college. My classmates are 4 years younger than me. I had friendship with a beautiful girl and and catched feelings for her, she made me feel good and put a smile on my face after a long time. I asked her indirectly about us getting married in future she rudely said Im a short guy and she don’t like short guys at all. I was about to lose her friendship so with a fake smile hiding my pain I said I was kidding. She knew it was not a joke and started ignoring me. Day by day she stopped texting me and when i called her she started fighting and told me leave her.

But I really feel like I am the loneliest person on Earth. Now I gonna tell about myself. I am studying at a coaching centre in a city Where population is just 14–15 lakh. So I am preparing for jee 2020. But I don't have much good friends, and literally no best friend. And almost 0 female interaction. Fuck the things about opposite gender, I don't even have boys on the name of friends. And my hair's are too thin, that even if I water my head. It will look like an watermelon with only some seeds. Means that, my head is totally visible. And also I am fat. It was my birthday some days ago, almost no one knew about it. Just mother, father and my sis. I wanna study, but just can't sit too long. And always my phone has message of 90% and 50% data usage. This things were really haunting me. So I started to write a dairy whatever the hell comes in mind, just wrote it on… Then there is a girl in my coaching, MANSI. So charming personality and my crush. I never tried to talk to anyone, especially towards girls. Always thinking about her, then I saw fucking topper talking too her. I felt a little strange, but soon I came to know that he is her boyfriend. So I hold myself very hard. Maybe because I just falled for her very much. And of course I never talked to any girl, so there was even no chance here too. Days passed and nothing new in my life. And my father and mother also have a lot of expectations as always. I thought this was the depression, so I tried hard to avoid all the things in my daily cycle. And my studies were like normal. Then after some days I thought that I am okay now. I was feeling awesome. So I thought there will be same people like me out there. Even now I don't have any friends. My classmates think that I am just a hritik roashan from koi mil Gaya. Means to say that, they were making fun of me. And of course this lead to my rude behavior with them. So I started an Instagram handle, to talk to people anonymously. So that I can know there pain and will try to make them feel better and off course to solve there problem. But I put in bio that I am girl. And started commenting on meme pages, so that people could notice it. And at the sudden, many people camed to tell there problem. Many boys and some girls. And 80% were about there realtionship. Like there ex cheated on them or they think that they are cheating on them. I started to talk to them and spend 25 hrs on insta in just 4 days. I was feeling very strange at that time. Then a girl messaged me that she is young and still studying and her father dead. They are living in a rented house and financially broke. She was asking for my help, and I didn't knew how to help her. This touched my heart very much that I can't really help people. So I stopped it. But again I am lonely. My phone usage is around of 7 hrs daily. Don't really know what to do. I watched many web shows from got to the 100. And also all from the tvf. But still feeling very tired all the time. And yes it is still the case. I forgot that I have a life. That I was a champion at my school till 10 th. And literally saying, MERE DIMAG KA BHOSADA HO GAYA HE. And don't know what to do . Soon after 2 months there will be jee and new year. So I am gathering my broken pieces together to be motivated. And also to study. I really don't know what to do, some songs makes me feel better for some time. And day dreaming always is the case. I even I don't have a good sleep. It's just my story. And I really think there is nothing much interesting left in my life. Just as usual things and nothing new. I also want friends, a group of friends where there will be girls there. And I could say I have bestie, a group of friends. But no god doesn't want this. So thank u for reading this boring answer, and really sorry if u think that I wasted ur time.

My husband is not the same man whom I dated or fell in love with head over heels. He's a changed man now! To begin with, 4 years ago my then boyfriend(now husband) was not earning enough to start a family. But yes! He made blind promises to me that he would gradually grow. I loved him whole-heartedly so I agreed to marry him despite all opposition from both sides of our respective families. My parents were in complete denial of this union, but I somehow convinced and promised by parents that I would stand by him through thick and thin and motivate him to success. Henceforth, I was successful to an extent, my husband's salary grew from a nominal 20k INR and now he earns close to 1.5–2 lakhs INR per month. But this wasn't easy. The road to success was rocky. In 4 years of my marriage, my husband was thrown out of a job three times. Everytime he loses job within an hour’s notice i.e., unemployed from the very next day. The first and second time he lost his job, I stood rock solid by him. All his friends would often tell him about how supportive I've been to him. But time and again, the more I do for him, the more he expects from me and feels it is a part of my responsibility as a wife. Nonetheless, he lost his job for the third time now and I'm emotionally drained. He never discusses why he loses his job everytime. To the extent, he never tries to work on his weaknesses too. He is dead stubborn. He never asks me even if I'm lying ill on the bed. He feels this is all sham. Lastly, he has never done anything for me till this date. We never go out. We didn't go for our honeymoon yet. Reason being he cannot afford it, as per his words. Neither is he interested in having a sexual or physical relationship with me. I always wanted to start a family, but he always avoids it stating that he ain't earning enough or is feeling sick. His negligence towards this relationship has left me in utter disgust and loneliness. To my dismay, my husband often says I'm responsible for his misfortune and he wants a legal separation from me soon. Hearing such harsh words broke all my trust and feelings for him. Hell broke loose, I have failed miserably and I have no place to go. I don't want to trouble my aging parents with my emotional breakdown. I went against their wishes to marry this insensitive guy. I feel suicidal sometimes, but stop myself from self-harm. If I do, my husband has nothing to lose, it's a huge LOSS for my parents. I love them very much and can never think of hurting them. I know someday I'll be gone and turn to ashes.

Time passed, I went to college. There was a girl there in my section whom I liked the most. We used to talk like anything. Our conversations will go whole of the night.

Anyway, they made sure to let me know that I could be happy to know I now have friends and kept telling me how worthless and invisible I am that it wouldn't make a difference whether I was there or not. That made me think that the reason I didnt have friends was because I dont deserve to have any. This affected me for the rest of my life, I wasnt indifferent about people anymore but very insecure about myself and questioned whether I deserved this or that. They cut my hair, destroyed my projects etc. which made me think that I don't want to have friends (at this point I connected the word friend with only negative stuff nobody needs).

I get birthday wishes from my parents and WhatsApp groups where someone posts it publicly that it's my birthday.

Anyway, I decided to enjoy my time with them.\", \"High school: Other kids considered me to be weird. I didn't even know if I was weird. I thought these guys are just temporary. No one has friends all the way back from high school. Pfft, ignore. I did have some crushes. Didn't confront them. There was a girl who had a crush on me. I stopped talking to her because I couldn't say yes(because she was fat). Didn't want to depress her by saying no(imagine if I was in her place!). Before graduating, we did talk for a while(very awkward). It was so long ago that I don't even remember what I said, but I think she got the message. That's the end of it.

I did appreciate the company, but the friendship became stale by the end of 2 years. There was a guy whom I considered as my best friend in the begining, and we used to dream of getting alloted the same IIT, hostel and dorm room. Yeah, we fantasized that shit. He was way smarter than me and I feared we wouldn't be neck to neck 20 years down the line. Academics and IIT became very very important. Occasionally we went to movies and sometimes I'd enjoy being in a gang, but mostly no. By the end, I hated everyone. It wasn't like people wanted to be friends with me. They just ignored me(was something wrong with me? Why do people like me in the begining and hate me later?). Sometimes that made me focus more on JEE, and sometimes that made me depressed. I'd dismiss all those emotions in the hope that I'd get into a good IIT and that'll be the end of all my miseries (including my parents who didn't make it easy for me). Captain America civil war came out while I was still here. We were huge marvel fans and I wanted to go to the movie with everyone else. I call up my “best friend” to make plans for the movie. He says “no dude, I'm going with my friends. I don't want to go with you”. He knew I had started to ignore him (JEE shit) and he despised me for ruining our friendship. I did manage to go with the gang, but watching that movie on Tony fight Steve was hard(remember “So was I”?) I knew this was the end of it and I had blown it once again. No best friends till now. Ok here comes IIT.\", \"IIT: turns out none of us did well and we weren't getting an old IIT. My “best friend” from the previous paragraph decided to go to a new IIT(no batches yet) because it was closer to home. I on the other hand chose to go to a slightly older IIT(opened in 2009) because it'll have more people. That was it. Our paths diverged and I lost the chance to retain a friend.

I knew everyone's names, where they're from, what they're like(mean? Friendly? Fun?). Turns out while everyone was busy making forming gangs, I was getting to know everyone. So by the end, I wasn't a part of any gang. I didn't have any close friends. Or a friend for that matter. I did have 2 roommates but one was very cold and the other was always busy with his girlfriend. When he finally broke up, he decided to give me more attention. After spending a lot of time together, I decided to call him as my new best friend. Hurray! I even got a 9+ CG in the first sem.\", \"In my sophomore year that guy betrayed me(long story) and I was depressed. For real this time. I started therapy and it fixed me for a while. I couldn't forgive him. He didn't know how big a deal making a best friend is for me. It broke me. Into a million pieces. I couldn't trust anyone again. All along I was in touch with a junior from my college(back home). I would advise her about JEE and all the crap that came with it. Since I knew what JEE was all about, I discouraged her to not care about JEE when I found out that she was only doing it because her dad had asked her to(things weren't easy for her). I honestly cared about such people and the scenario they're put in. Turns out we began to like each other and we were having a long distance relationship even if we weren't ready to admit it. She helped me become emotionally mature and I helped her relax her mind. It was nice in the beginning. She didn't clear JEE and decided to drop a year. I dunno what happened, things went south and I began to hate her(I felt that she had become manipulative). We “broke up”. Stopped talking. It was ugly.\", \"Junior year: I realised how truly lonely I was when I had to take a single room because no one wanted to be around me. How did this happen again?? I thought I was making friends. Earlier when I was getting to know others, they got to know me as well. They decided not to be with me. No one. Every semester I averaged 2 depressions, but the 5th semester takes the cake. With intervews for internships going on, I think I've been through 4 this time. It just made me stronger. I learnt how to live by myself with no one other than my mind and a single room.

My father is very innocent. That's why everyone yells at him even his younger brother doesn't respect him. That's make me very sad even I can't do anything. And my mom used to say leave this house. We can live anywhere where we find peace. And my dad is government employee his income is 40k per month which is enough for our livelihood even this is more than enough to a below middle class family. Whenever my uncle grand parents are abusing my dad and we ( me my mom and my brothers one is younger than me and one is elder than me) are protecting him. My dad yells at us and also beats.

The real problem started after 11:30 when the pain got severe and all I was doing was to turn on my sides on the bed pressing my stomach as hard as possible. It was unbearable pain.

I couldn’t dial home as my parents sleep very early and disturbing them would cause much tension at home. I also thought of calling an ambulance but I wasn’t able to get up from the bed.

Though, I must admit that my husband is way more caring and loving but those were the situations which need to be blamed. Because of my husband's job, we had to move to a different city and rent out an apartment. About me, I am an introvert person, who speaks very less, only when the situation demands. Consequently I had very limited social circle which has shrunk to size zero since we moved out. Now I am all alone in my own world inside the four walls of the house, no one to talk with. I kill my time with household chores and rest dreaming about a world where I am surrounded by people, relationships and see myself talking. I have a dire need to see living beings. Even a glance of somebody makes me feel alive. I am afraid to stay at home. Recently, I got hospitalized for few days due to some serious illness and it would be quite surprising for you when I say that I didn't want to come back home as I was more surrounded by humans there. I couldn't work because of my introvert nature and therefore bound to stay home.

Cooperation is important, but if your teamates are not so diligent and industrious, who should u rely on? The answer is yourself.\\n•So let's say that u feel lonely. It's not a big deal. Don't give a damn about it and get down to do something. Do u have a dream or something u like? Just go for it. If u say, oh that costs a lot, oh that's too hard for me. Then u can turn to Quora.

U know, if u r really good at something, of course there will be someone asking u for help.

After I have decided to stay in the US in order to pursue a better education (a little pressure from parents) I learned what loneliness really is.

One can be alone without being lonely, and one can be lonely in a crowded room. Loneliness is, therefore, a state of mind, an emotion brought on by feelings of separation from other human beings. The sense of isolation is very deeply felt by those who are lonely. The Hebrew word translated “desolate” or “lonely” in the Old Testament means “one alone, only; one who is solitary, forsaken, wretched.” There is no deeper sadness that ever comes over the mind than the idea that we are alone in the world, that we do not have a friend, that no one cares for us, that no one is concerned about anything that might happen to us, that no one would care if we were to die or shed a tear over our grave.', 'No one felt loneliness more keenly than David. In a series of earnest, heartfelt appeals to God, David cried out in his loneliness and despair. His own son was risen up against him, the men of Israel went after him, and he was forced to flee from the city, and leave his house and family. Lonely and afflicted (Psalm 25:16), his only recourse was to turn to God and plead for mercy and God’s intervention (Psalm 25:21) because his only hope was in God. It is interesting to note that the word “lonely” is never used in the New Testament to describe people. In the New Testament, the word “lonely” only occurs twice and both times refers to desolate places (Mark 1:45; Luke 5:16), where Jesus moved off into the wilderness to be alone.', 'Whatever the cause of loneliness, for the Christian the cure is always the same—the comforting fellowship of Christ. That loving relationship with our Master has reassured and encouraged countless thousands who languished in prisons and even went to their deaths for His sake. He is the friend who “sticks closer than a brother” (Proverbs 18:24), who lays down His life for His friends (John 15:13-15), and who has promised never to leave us or forsake us but to be with us until the end of the age (Matthew 28:20).

Currently I’m on a vacation in Hawaii with my brother and neice so we can be at my dads and mother in laws wedding and ever since the first day of being here I’ve been feeling very off each day everytime that more of each side of the family members come into Hawaii and everyday both sides of my dads and my mother in laws family celebrate our trip together in Hawaii by going swimming, hiking, eating fancy dinners, visiting Pearl Harbor and visiting different beaches and museums. And mind you that this is my first time ever going on any trip like this and I always see stuff like this only in movies or on social media. So far for the most part it’s actually pretty fun here and I’m really enjoying the weather and views of the island, but besides the good parts of being here, I still do have my very bad ones as well. Everytime I have every little each relieve of stress from having my cheap thrills here, depression, anxiety, paranoia, and confusion always seems to find a way to get to me no matter what situation I’m in. And just like you I’m 16 years old and I’m always thinking about my past back when I never cared about stuff like this and back when I was still in middle school always hanging out with my small group of friends and in freshman. And it makes me realize how much I missed those days and sometimes I wish I could just go back and relive those moments and appreciate them more. And lately I’ve been feeling so lonely even tho I’m surrounded by so much family, so lonely that sometimes I really wish I had a girlfriend to care for and look out for and look towards too and talk too when I’m feeling alone and I just space out in my own head fantasizing about making passionate love with a beautiful girl of my dreams and I wish that those dreams can turn into reality. But I just know deep down I’ll never get a girl, period, I’ve tried so hard for the longest and it seems like I can’t even be comfortable with myself and i can’t even socialize with my own family, strangers or old friends no matter what I do or how hard I try. So how the fuck am I gonna have a girl if I can’t even do the simplest thing that any other human being can easily do. I try asking for advice from my brother, parents and other family members and they all tell me the same thing that I always try over and over and they act like I never been told the same thing before like I never tried doing what they tell me a million times, for example they always just tell me like “oh just make conversation”, “don’t be shy”, “just try not to be awkward”, don’t be nervous”, “just be yourself and talk to people” like if only they knew how hard it is done than said. And trust me I totally get that there helping me and its all out of love but it’s just that I’m a very complicated person and what they tell me to do never seems to work. It just seems that no matter what I look forward to for comfort to take away my pain of guilt, embarrassment, and depression, nothing really works for me anymore. I’ve ran out of all ends to look for when i feel sad but nothing makes me happy any more even the stuff that I use to or currently enjoy even in the slightest, it just feels nothing works for me anymore. I get I’m just a teenager still and I still have the rest of my life to live for and experience and to better myself as a person mentally and physically but to be honest I swear to god I really feel like I’ve been through a lot in life with the way my life’s been since I was a baby. I’m not gonna lie I do think about suicide when I do get to me deepest darkest areas of my heart and mind but I know I can never go through with it because I’m scared of a lot of things, things that would take me forever to talk about in words. It’s seems like too that it’s hard in any social situation or even talking to myself to translate from what’s such a perfect thought, statement, or opinion on something always comes out very differently when I talk, I know i sound weird and crazy but that’s just how I feel. Now if you’ve read this far I appreciate that you’ve took your time just to read a random strangers comment online even if you could’ve just kept scrolling or continued on with whatever other business your up to. I just hope that someone out there can learn from this or just help me out and give me some more advice, I’d be more than appreciated if someone can recognize me, and not be judgemental that’d be awesome. And I don’t wanna continue on making you people feel bad for me and I know many people all over the world are going through way worse things and I really shouldn’t feel bad about what I’m going through.

Then the many summers I had to think of so many creative ways to make kids on the block want to play with me. No one wanted to play with me! I moved around to fast, talked to fast, to rough. One summer I got all the neighborhood boys to play with me all summer by doing what they liked, playing football. But being so different I had to find someway to play football that was better then any time they played with out me. I called all over town challenging other boys to come to our part of town and play on our field. Then , me, this 5th grader started clearing a field, made Gole Post, dug holes, put the poles in the ground, found some lime and made the boundaries and teams came from all parts of the city to play. I had friends all summer long …….. for only a few summers that is. Because of my ADHD I missed the part in school that instilled the lies we are taught, that we must follow in order to have friends, good sex, success, money and power. Because I missed all the fabulous teachings, even though I was present, I never knew that if you have no friends, you are socially misfit, therefore must be depressed and a social out cast. To tell you the truth, I function better with no friends. Even as a child, a lone with no friends, I would build the coolest underground forts. Dig a big hole, put plywood as the roof, cover it with dirt, get candles and my little green army men, and fly off to a different world. Moral of the story is, if you fight yourself because of yourself you never will find out what God intended you to be .,……. yourself\", 'I understand how you feel. Couple ideas. One, to apply to your close friends; one to reach out beyond yourself.\\n\\nHere\\'s the deal: People like walking on soft ground. Think of walking on soft, fertile ground. It\\'s springtime, rain came last night, there\\'s a couple flowers here and there. Think of how it feels to walk there, then try to make accessing the best parts of you feel like that to other people.\\n\\nIt takes vulnerability on your part, at least a little, for people to want to speak to your needs... everybody wants to be asked, \"How\\'s it going? How\\'s school/work/lovelife/ family? Everyone needs hugs. Everyone needs someone to miss them.\\n\\nTry and make it inviting for people to enter into the living room of your soul. Do some thinking. Some people need a bunch of words to come close. Others, just a little plain speak will do it.\\n\\nUp your emotional intelligence in this area-n actually \"play\" or \"experiment\" with different techniques of bringing people close to you; this is my first suggestion.\\n\\nHere\\'s the other: Find someone, an elder, a handicapped person, a ill child, someone to give to.\\n\\nExample from my own life: I did this little giveaway at Christmas in the 150-unit, low-income apartment complex where my son and I live. The last family I reached out to needed a blanket for the man. But I only had enough to get the kids from the eight families we gave to, so I didn\\'t make it by Christmas. Instead, I could only visit with the gift of a little musical snow globe then get the blanket later.\\n\\nI went by the apartment; knocked three times, no one was home.\\n\\nI exited left, down the stairs to visit another family. Lo and behold, here\\'s the wife just coming in. I say hi, make sure I have the right person. Is Brian home? \"No,\" she said, \"I\\'m so sorry, but Brian just passed away this morning. I just got done making all the arrangements for the body.\"\\n\\nI looked closer and saw the ordeal of the last 24 hours on this petite brunette\\'s face. I could see the tension and fatigue under her eyes, around her shoulders, and in the very frame of her body. I said I had something, did she want me to come in now?\\n\\nShe said yes. In 20 or so minutes, I found out we both loved Jesus; that her\\' husband\\'s deer skull and dragon bugged her and she was going to get rid of them; that she had brothers from her family and his coming in to help her thin things out. She cried her first couple tears at the home where she lived with her husband of eight years unalone; she got hugged; she got prayer and helped pray. And she made a friend, because she let me be there for her, and I wasn\\'t, for that minute, useless. All because I was late but kept trying anyway.\\n\\nGod works in us, in our friends, in our enemies, in a very mysterious way.\\n\\nYou may be more important to those friends than you know. They may be thinking you\\'re above them or something odd. Maybe you just ask them, \"Do you have a second to ask me how I am?\" Maybe they then think worse. Or maybe you find a real friend.\\n\\nThe lady called me a few times over the next few weeks, usually at night, when she ws getting lonely, to tell me mostly good news. Yesterday, six weeks now since Brian passed, this youthful looking woman my age came by yesterday because my phone was off; she came by with a nice guy who has been helping her not be alone; she came by with a smile, her lively dark brown eyes alert to her new life alone. She brought the \"spirit\" of friendship with her, the kind I used to enjoy so much in high school before all my weaknesses took over and ruined my life.\\n\\nToday, I think of how I had something special to tell her about something girls like to talk to each other about (what else, but a guy...), and how I had to tell her to the side that I had something to tell her. Her coming by, seeing the spark of her life growing, even now, it\\'s making me smile.\\n\\nSo, if you read down this far, you\\'ve got enough time: Go find a few people, maybe even just one, to whom you can give unconditionally for their sake. Sowing a seed that is unconditional will make you feel good, and you will start looking for other ops to get that good feeling again. This will make the loneliness fade.', 'My ministering to that little gal, just \"happening\" to be there RIGHT when she got back from making final arrangements for her mate, was part of God\\'s plan for me to not be so lonely either. He has a plan for you too, and he didn\\'t make us all so that we can all go around desperate for love. I mean, seriously, what does it take to stop and visit someone?', \"If you are not a mean spirited person I would highly suggest getting a Golden Retriever. The reason I mention the mean spirited thing is really for your own protection. Because if I ever saw you abusing a dog I would have to really mess you up. But if you are a kind and gentle person, having a dog can really turn things around for you. It doesn't have to be a Golden Retriever, any dog will do, but Goldens are void of any meanness and just about as fun loving as any dog could be. There are some Idiots out there that say dogs are incapable of smiling. I know this to be false, and so does anybody else who's been met at the door by a Golden. But all this may just sound like unproven theory to you. So here are some things to think about. By getting a dog you would be responsible for the life of another. And there is nothing that can snap you out of the doldrums quicker than knowing something is going be hungry or feel suffering unless you do something about it. But this only applies if you are a kind person. Also, by having a dog, you would be forced to get out of the house to walk it. And it has been scientifically proven that fresh air and movement help against depression. And when outdoors with your dog, you are definitely going to be stopped and talked to by other dog lovers, thus affording you an opportunity to meet new and interesting people. Now I have been running on the assumption that you don't already have a dog. If I am wrong and you do have one, then all I can say is you need to pull your head out of your ass and go hug it and look at it for what it is and what it can be. A dog can and will be the most loyal friend you can ever hope to have. It will love you and never once judge you. In fact, it craves your love. So think about that and go discuss it with your Mom. Explain to her, honestly, about how you are not happy. Show her your question that you wrote here. She's your Mom and she loves you, she almost certainly doesn't want you to be sad. If it's a matter of a landlord not allowing it. You could call your dog a service dog. It is illegal for anyone to ask for proof, and you wouldn't be lying anyway because it would be serving you in your fight against sadness. Anyway, if this is the route you choose to take, please remember to be kind to the dog. And in the big picture of things, your going to be alright. So don't worry too much and allow the good things to happen. They are all around you, sometimes it just takes awhile before you recognize them. Peace to you!\", \"I'm sorry you're feeling lonely. I know that's not a good feeling. Are you feeling lonely because you don't have any friends, or is it something else? If you're looking to make friends, you may have to put in a little effort. Do you play any sports or are you a member of any clubs? Those can be great ways to meet people who share your same interests. Another thought is to volunteer. There are tons of organizations and I would venture to guess that all of them wouldn't mind having another volunteer. Volunteering is a great way to meet people who care about the things you care about and to make a difference, as well. One other thing I would mention is reading. Reading is good because it something you can do entirely on your own. By reading, you can basically enter another's world. In essence, reading is the kind of escape. I would suggest that you isolate yourself entirely, but really might be a good way to help you when you're feeling especially lonely. I hope this helps him and that you start to feel less lonely soon. All my best to you.\", 'Look around you. Look at the things you own. Think of all the people who made it, packed it, shipped it to you, delivered it to your door. Think of the people who put it on a shelf and the people who took it down.

If you already have one, get off the internet and go talk to it. Go talk to a sibling or someone else who won’t pass any judgement on you. Talk to a mirror.

But, in the long term, learn to love yourself and have a good time on your own. That helps more than anything! Loneliness isn’t about being alone. It’s about feeling like no one has your back; but that is just a feeling! It doesn’t reflect reality, but it will take some time and experience to learn it on your own. And you will! But be patient with yourself! Take time and be kind. If you would be kind to another in your situation, show that same kindness to yourself. Treat yourself like you would treat another, with care and generosity and patience.', 'I had to learn all this, too.', 'Best of luck! Blessings!', 'My first bit of advice would be to try not to take those three friends for granted. Maybe you could try to do new things with them, suggest trips and things to bond you as a group and to make new memories. Having a few good people around you that you know you can trust is a great thing and that comfort can be hard to find should you lose them. Invest in them and take the time to do new things. Books are a great way to inspire, so why not try to read some motivational books? If you think you could be depressed then please tell someone close to you that you trust. I would not advise using the internet as it can create a safety net feeling of having people there without real connection.', \"I can relate to how you are feeling despite being twice your age. I have endured an extremely lonely few years. No one really prepares you in your mid twenties for what will follow, friends going off and getting married, having families and doing their own thing, moving away. I found myself in a situation where a particularly toxic so called friend decided to completely pick apart my character over a perceived sleight, bringing in to it other friends. At a time when I was suffering from severe anxiety, loneliness and depression. All things she made me feel weak for enduring; despite me doing it alone as her and the others all lived far away and were consumed with their own lives, kids, husbands, etc. Their visits to see each other and trips spent together without inviting me have been hard to witness lately, since it all happened with the toxic ex friend they rarely bother to see how I am. I could be dead and they wouldn't know unless social media told them. I have been considering unfriending them all. These are the sort of people that it'd hard to salvage things with, due to resentment and feeling let down, isolated. Since they all went in different directions keeping in touch with each other but ignoring me, I have been very lonely, without a decent family for support, they meant a lot to me. Now I spend a lot of time alone.\", \"It is hard to make new friends, a fellow poster noted that when lonely you can try too hard to make new friends, getting caught in a vicious cycle. Of you go home to an empty house, want to do things but instead don't bother as going alone is too worrying and your confidence can crack. If your friends treat you badly then by all means do thing about removing them from your life, if you are in a rut of boredom jump out of it. Go on a camping trip, for a day out, or even just somewhere new, build new memories and make the most of having them. It sounds like you are a bit bored and uninspired, so do something new that you have not tried before.

I think that is what boredom is, along with aspects of loneliness. Biographies take us out of ourself.

It was also due to the fact that I was gay and scared of coming out. In the 70’s being gay was far less acceptable than it is now. I also grew up in a KKK town. Not a town to come out in. (They would probably freak out to find out that I am not only gay but also in a long term relationship, over 13 years, with a black man. The love of my life.) But to get back on track, boys in middle school or in early high school often experiment with each other. With me being so afraid to come out I was also trying to deny my being gay, so the “experimenting” with other boys was my only way of acting out with my sexuality. However, when the middle school boys got older, the started dating girls and I felt lonely again. So. once again I gravitated to other middle school boys. I’m sure by now you can see where this is going. I convinced myself that I was still “experimenting”. It was very hard and lonely every time that the boys would get older and move on with their lives. I felt as if everyone was outgrowing me. It was very lonely for me. It eventually got to the point where I was an adult and was still trying to “experiment” with boys in middle school. This ended up sending me to prison for 18 years. During that time I got the treatment that I needed to change my life around. As I mentioned earlier, I am now in a long term relationship with someone my own age, and am extremely happy with my life now.

Truth be told I’m not sure there is a single thing I can say to add to it all. I’ve read most of the answers and everything I could say has been said in one fashion or another. So why am I bothering to add to the chatter? I guess I just want to help. I just can’t ignore a young voice crying out in the dark. So what can I possibly say to help? Your not alone, I’ve been there and there are others in the same place you are right now. That doesn’t make your pain any less painful though. When I was young and in that black pit of despair similar to yours I couldn’t see a way out. Unlike you I didn’t even have one friend. I was the new girl. The one people made fun of. Then another new girl came and I thought she might be my friend or at least divert attention from me but it only got worse. When she joined in on the tormenting I called her the worst name I could think of and then I felt like slime. I felt bad because I was now no better then all the rotten kids who liked to hurt the small kids, the new kids, the week or different kids. That’s when something started to change. Not with the kids but with me. I started to decide just what kind of person I wanted to be. Now yours isn’t a case of bulling but having been bullied I can tell you I felt extremely alone. That incident was a gentle epiphany in my life, one of three that began my journey into adulthood. That was the day I decided that I needed to work on “ME” and forget “THEM”. I’m sure someone in all these answers mentioned this to you already but its important enough to repeat. Work on yourself. Make your life one you like, make yourself someone you like. Stop sitting at home in the dark. Go out there and learn about life and what you want out of it. There is more to it then the four walls of your house. Now I know someone said that, lol. Those two other little epiphanies I had? Well I’m not sure they are the same for everyone. I think you need to go out there and find yours. It’s kind of like that movie “City Slickers”, Curly holds up his finger and says you have to find that one thing. Well you can’t find your one thing sitting at home. My next epiphany I found while doing a class photo assignment for an art class with a home made box camera. I learned even in my dark child's life I could find beauty. You can find it anywhere even in a trash heap, you just need to look for it. Again you need to go look for it. My third epiphany was around the age of 19, when I saw how sudden a life could change or end. No matter how bad you feel, just hang on, before you know it, life will change in a flash. Be strong and soldier on. Which led me to something I learned latter in life, not an epiphany but important none the less. Like someone else said a smile can go a long way. In this case I’m talking about someone else’s smile though. When ever I felt really low and alone, I’d go do something for someone and look for a smile and give them mine. It helps. Good luck finding your epiphanies, maybe you’ll take one of mine or one from someone else who answered you. They’re right you know. You have to be willing to change. You have to be willing to conceive of a life that’s different from the one you have now. The longer you live the more you learn.

Most mental health struggles do not live in isolation, and many of us have negative thought or mood tendencies that, while challenging, do not qualify as a disorder.As a relationship coach, I’ve found that loneliness is one of these tendencies that often come along with a diagnosed mental health disorder. While correlation is not causation, it seems that loneliness could be more of a cause than a symptom in some of our commonly recognized mental health issues.Human closeness is fundamental to our mental well-being; without it, any number of pathologies could plague us. The loneliness that arises from a lack of human closeness could easily bring about any number of presenting problems.', '1.) Depression:', 'Loneliness and depression have always gone hand-in-hand. We’ve all experienced moments when we find ourselves a little down due to a lack of close friendships. If someone had', 'no', 'close relationships in her life, it’s not a stretch to assume she would feel some powerful malaise as a result.Recently, a study conducted over a five year period at the University of Chicago found that the presence of loneliness early in the five year span was an excellent predictor for depression later in the five year span. In fact, loneliness was an even better predictor than the presence of depression itself early in the five year span. What does this indicate? Loneliness may precede depression even more frequently than depression precedes depression.', '2.) Social Anxiety:', 'If one’s loneliness is not caused by physical isolation (such as living in a very sparsely populated town), it’s reasonable to think loneliness may be caused by discomfort getting to know people. This is usually called social anxiety. While there are extreme forms of this problem – not being able to leave the house, for example – the more mild symptoms of social anxiety could be caused by feeling alone. You may feel as if you’re unlikeable or unworthy of good relationships, causing fear and anxiety about the process of forming them. Lonely people are not lonely because they don’t know how to talk to people. Instead, findings suggest they struggle with relationships because they are scared of messing up– they worry about saying the wrong thing in social situations. I see this as suggesting that loneliness and social anxiety may be intertwined, creating a vicious cycle of isolation and fear of isolation.', '3.) Addiction:', 'Released in January 2015, Johann Hari’s revolutionary book', 'Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on', 'made people aware that drug addiction may be much more than just chemical hooks in the brain. He posits that when people lead lives full of closeness with others, they do not become addicted to drugs – even when they are put on powerful painkillers after an accident, for example. But the opposite is also true. Those who feel lonely', 'before', \"ever taking a drug are much more likely to get hooked. , As we references the work of Professor Peter Cohen, who says: “If we can't connect with each other, we will connect with anything we can find - the whirr of a roulette wheel or the prick of a syringe. [Professor Cohen] says we should stop talking about 'addiction' altogether, and instead call it 'bonding.' A heroin addict has bonded with heroin because she couldn't bond as fully with anything else. So the opposite of addiction is not sobriety. It is human connection.”\", '4.) Hoarding:', 'While hoarding is generally categorized as an obsessive-compulsive disorder, there is an element of loss and heartache in filling one’s life up with stuff. When we’re not able to fill up our lives with close friends and family, some people may turn to comforting objects to fill the void. The International Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Foundation speaks directly to this, stating: \"Loneliness is one of the main factors that causes hoarding to occur.”article continues after advertisementWe’ve likely all touched on this tendency to a certain extent – holding on to the trinkets, letters, and keepsakes of a relationship that’s ended, for example. These objects may “fill the emptiness,” but as the emptiness gets bigger, so may the mountain of objects.If you suffer from one of the above conditions, or know someone who does, it may be worth considering if loneliness is playing a part in perpetuating the problem. Addressing your loneliness could be the key to unleashing your healthy mind.', 'Vinay Bargat', 'Solitude is a State of the Mind and loneliness is a feeling. Man is a social being by nature. In other words, interactions with other others is a process of learning and encourages the growth of the mind hence, the personality. Communication with other minds gives the very motivation to live life. Therefore, when solitude is awarded as a punishment then loneliness becomes painful because firstly, it is perceived as a punishment and secondly, as it goes against the basic grain of human emotional requirement or desire.', \"But when solitude is self imposed in a measured and planned manner with a purpose, then it becomes a boon. It provides the opportunity to spend time with oneself. It is important to to create a space for the self as it is an imperative condition for self analysis or introspection. Introspection is the crucial attribute of an evolved personality. It is a means to achieve wisdom and maturity. Some individuals are afraid of spending time with themselves and they often hide behind the excuse of the natural and the dire need to socialise. Why are they afraid of spending time in solitude? Most often it's their habitual behaviour of evading problems or uncomfortable thoughts. It is an escapist attitude. It may also be a sign of the lack of self confidence. In other words, such individuals may lack the basic skills to analyse and find solutions to their problems. It may also be that they not only have a highly developed sense of defence mechanism but in a state of incompetency, they would avoid being with self. Obviously to prevent situations where self realisation of one's faults are likely to happen.\", \"Therefore, loneliness is a feeling and the intensity of which will depend on one's mental make up and would affect an individual accordingly.

I grew up with her, and though we saw one another seldom, and otherwise almost did not speak to one another, when we were together, we were inseparable. We made and make each other happy. We were in all things, together, and nothing else seemed to matter. She made me feel free, even when I had so much else going on in my life. We talked without restraint, and we laughed together, at times, even without saying anything. On vacations, it was always us who were farthest out in the water, who were always ahead of the hiking group, always climbing in the trees and sharing the little things we found. It was always us who were holding hands. I've had a crush on her since about 8 years ago. She was my best friend, and I did not dare to show it.\\nWe began to text one another. We held hands watching the fireworks, and continued to lay there, watching the stars. I swore an oath that night that I would never ever break her heart if she entrusted me with it. I've never regretted that. Soon after, we nearly simultaneously admitted our feelings. We dated, and it was the greatest feeling, even though we were almost always physically apart.

The way they said it, it was obvious that they thought I didn't like her either--and that they might berserk and hurt her if they found out. Every time I saw her, though, I couldn't keep myself away from her, no matter how hard I tried. I always got yelled at a bit afterwards, but I didn't really care.\\nI told her about this, when we started dating (in secret) so she would know why I could never bring her on a real date. She accepted anyway. We dated for two months. Whenever we saw each other in person, we positively exploded with affection. It was challenging to keep our relationship a secret, but still one of the best things I have ever done. And the main reason we never kissed was because I never did. I felt it best to wait until she wanted to. I have kind of unsightly lips, so I wanted her to decide whether or not to kiss. I figured if she did, she would kiss me. I probably should have mentioned it, but I didn't, so she never knew. In hindsight, I definitely fell short of the ball there.\\nEventually, she left me. It was a peaceful good-terms breakup. I can understand why it happened; I was a terrible boyfriend, honestly. And with my parents, I probably couldn't marry her anyway. She really tried to keep it alive, and I did too, but it just didn't work out. I think she hates me now. At least, she doesn't love me. She stopped talking to me, and blocked me in all the ways we used to talk.

It hurts knowing that I will probably never see her again, and that she definitely won't ever have another relationship with me (seeing how stressful the first one was to keep) much less marry me. I still keep it as much a secret as I can, so my parents don't hurt her. I don't think she realizes that's what they would probably do, and I don't want her to worry. No one I've talked to or known seems even close in comparison. Some people have found out; I've spilled everything, and they've kept it a secret. But soon after they forget, so it's almost as if I never told them. Well, at least they will keep the secret if they forget what it is. Sometimes, I just write long notes to myself and burn them.

I don't believe that I have actually ever felt loneliness. I like being alone and crave time on my own when I have been around people a lot socially or after working all week.\", \"I read somewhere that one needs to feel comfortable in their own skin before they can truly be comfortable being alone with themselves. This has never been true for me. Most of my life I was not comfortable in my own skin but still craved alone time. It wasn't until my diagnosis of Asperger's that I came to accept myself, my strengths and limitations, learning to settle into that and be alright with who I am.\", 'I think standing alone and not feeling lonely is quite a personal and individual thing. Through introspection and input from knowledgeable and trusted influences we learn what our strengths are and how to maximize those. To stand alone I believe we also need to explore our weaknesses to better understand when it is appropriate and in our best interest to ask for assistance. Requesting assistance does not imply that you are not able to stand alone, quite to the contrary, it means you recognize that in order to stand alone, sometimes you may need help. Knowing when to ask for that shows you have insight. This is a strength.', \"Feeling lonely (or not) while standing alone seem not even connected in my way of thinking. If your desire to stand alone excludes other people when you are a naturally social person then you must recognize that about yourself. If being social gives you strength then capitalize on that as it probably helps to build you up. There isn't anything wrong with that. People like helping others learn to stand alone. Accepting that and integrating socialization into your plan to stand alone should reconcile any fear of loneliness.\", 'I think there are two parts to the answer to this question:', 'As Candyce Ossefort-Russell insightfully observes there are two parts to your question.

As there are lots of people who manage to live together and feel lonely and could use the advice of Candyce as well.', 'If you plan your living alone life and actively execute your plan you will find you have little time left to feel lonely, maybe when you are alone in bed just moments before you fall asleep after a busy day managing living alone and just after you woke up you feel lonely.', 'However the most important part about not feeling lonely is accepting yourself and your situation. And accepting yourself and your situation is accepting that the norm society and your parents and your family puts on living with a partner and getting children is bogus. There are lots of people who do not get children and there are lots of people who do not live with someone else. So living alone may be against the norm, but it is not abnormal.', 'If you can accept that you live alone and that it does not reflect on you as a person and a human being, you will find that you stop feeling lonely. If you have a problem with accepting yourself you could try to find council or a therapist that helps you accept that you are not abnormal because you live alone.', 'Btw, an important activity to keep the feeling of loneliness at bay is living a healthy life with enough movement, enough mental challenges and a healthy and balanced eating pattern. As loneliness can be a signal of a beginning depression, due to unhealthy living.', 'What you also could do is explore this feeling of loneliness and try to find out if it has a basis in the reality of your life or that it might be a figment of your imagination. As humans we are rather good at thinking ourselves into a feeling that has nothing to do with where we are in our lives at the moment. So we are very capable of thinking we are lonely just because we are alone. Where it just might be boredom, because we do not know what to do next, but find boredom just a little bit to mundane to accept as a feeling, so we think we are lonely, which is so much more grandiose and exceptional as a feeling and makes us feel special and unique. Yes our brain is a great instrument: It is the ultimate Baron Von Münchhausen: It can think itself into a bog, and it can think itself out of a bog.', 'I have lived alone for most of my adult life and I truly enjoy my alone time. Getting married at 45 changed a lot for me. I have several hobbies and interests so I’ve never found myself with nothing to do. I cannot remember the last time I was bored, if in fact I’ve ever been bored. I have always had a cat or a dog or both at the same time so they get frequent attention playing and cuddling and bring me unlimited laughter or loads of fun with their antics. Every one of my cats knew how to fetch and hubby calls me Dr. Dolittle because animals listen to me, his favorite was the wild turkeys crossing the road and I hollered out the window to let me drive by, the turkeys ran to the side of the road they were closest to and waited for me to go by and then continued on their way. We used to live in the middle of a forest and I always had chipmunks and squirrels, deer, wild turkey, occasionally an elk or a bear roam through the yard. We had a squirrel family that would chirp outside my window and I had to go give them their food every morning. The girl died and the boy appeared really sad and would follow me around even getting into my car on hot days when I’d open the sliding doors in case I wanted to go anywhere and didn’t want to get into the 120 degree hot car. Chippy would hop in and get on my seat and lounge. After a couple years he would listen and come running when I called him.', 'I had a lot of friends before I got married and could always have a guest for dinner over if I just didn’t want to eat alone. I was active and involved in several community activities and I traveled around the state for musical performances three weekends of the month—the fourth weekend was all mine. My busy life was enhanced by my alone time because I could focus on myself and not a family or a spouse so I didn’t get run down trying to juggle someone elses calendar along with mine.', 'I truly enjoy my own company, (I live for the days hubby works a double shift or has to go do a setup for his business). That is pretty important for most everyone though because you take better care of yourself if you like yourself. I have a great imagination and can make myself laugh or I don’t get laughed at because I am doing something silly or stupid. I like to write and often get invites from some professionals I know asking if I will write an article or two or if I will proof or fact check their articles. I have a phone but rarely use it. My mom and oldest call on my birthday and my oldest calls me on Mothers Day otherwise my phone sits quietly and behaves.', 'I enjoy spending time with my guests when I have them so it isn’t like I don’t like people. I just found it easier and less stressful to live alone. Nobody messed up something I cleaned, nobody changed the channel on me. Nobody griped about how much time I was spending on the computer. Nobody (this is my #1 like) ever bounced my checking account since I always know my balance to the penny. I’ve never had any arguments about the temperature I kept the house or had to buy food I didn’t like. Nobody made my shower dirty and nobody ever kept me awake with their snoring. Now I have a puppy that snores louder than any person I know so that one is cancelled out.', 'The biggest thing is to like yourself, enjoy your own company. It took me a few years to realize that I didn’t need to spend all my time with someone else and started to cherish time alone. I actually prefer to be alone now too but I accept that I do need help due to my disability, and I am able to compromise. I really look forward to the time when hubby works a lot or goes out of town for a couple of days. We just have to carefully plan how I am going to eat on those days and stuff, I am not so much a picky eater so having a sandwich or fruit cups works as a meal for me—I love fruit and raw vegetables. Hubby going away for a few days is not impossible, it just takes a little planning. Also, in an emergency or for urgent needs when hubby is out of town, one of my 150 cousins that live nearby will help if I make a phone call. They’ll jump right in if I ask.

Once you jot down, start working on getting them done. As long as you have your focus preoccupied on some or the other task, you will never feel lonely. What you can do other than this to keep your mind at ease is to meditate and relax. By meditating you will be able to put your mind at ease and you will be able to know yourself better.

I did for some time have my 4 bedroom house and my kids were only with me part of the week and with their dad part. I’d miss them a lot and have to find ways to deal with that. I’d actually spend more time in my room than in the rest of the house as it was warmer there. I liked taking baths by candlelight and listening to r n b old school. I sipped wine, or various teas.

Another suggestion-which is something my sister started doing, is to look online as to things going on in y9ur community.there are often festivals, lectures at local libraries, nature walks, food and wine tastings, and free jazz concerts. Even if you go solo, these events can be lots of fun and you may even meet people.', 'Volunteering is another way to do something that means something t9 you where y9u also may connect with others who also are caring individuals.

It has a purposeful and determined ring to it. I’m assuming that you wish to stand in your own space, be a more integrated person. It sounds like someone who wishes to achieve completeness in themselves. This is a noble and good thing to aspire to. I’m also assuming that the emotion that may be preventing you from achieving your goal is your ‘fear’ of loneliness. Perhaps somewhere in your past, being yourself was stifled by someone? In my own story, I was ‘dragooned’ into the task of making my mother happy (my father was an alcoholic). In the process, I lost my true identity. As a loving boy, I honoured my mother’s needs but neglected my own. I didn’t seem to have a choice in this dysfunctional interplay. The alternative would have been ostracisation, exile and - loneliness. Now, in later life, I see how I was ‘sidetracked’ into this Narcissistic relationship. And so breaking away from it incurs guilt and loneliness (all the things I would have felt had I not acceded to her needs when I was a boy). So, in order to achieve MY goals - recovering my true self and nature, to stand alone - I have these horrible feelings of loneliness. But they are transient! They are fleeting! They will soon disappear! As I grow and recover my identity, I feel stronger and more integrated. Your story will probably be different but the thing to remember when striving for your goals is that you will meet your demons along the way. Loneliness was one of those demons.
